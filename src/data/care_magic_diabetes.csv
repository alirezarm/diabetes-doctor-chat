They are accelerated by factors affecting blood vessels such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etcetera. So the only thing that can be done to slow down this process is checking for the presence of those factors and ad Chat Doctor. As for the mild volume loss that means the mild shrinking of the brain. Again that is part of aging, all of us start to lose brain cells after our thirties, so as we age volume loss accumulates.

Insulin is used to treat diabetes during pregnancy at all stages and is safe and effective. The disease of diabetes and high blood sugar is the part that is dangerous for the baby, and good glucose control is the best way to ensure a healthy child. Good blood glucose levels should be less that 95 for fasting levels and less than 120 after meals (2 hours).  If this is the way your wife checks her sugar, and you test at least 4 times daily, she is under very good control and should not need further adjustment of her insulin if her levels stay at the current level.  She should be checking her sugar fasting and then 2 hours after every meal.  So in summary, insulin is safe and absolutely necessary for the health of the baby if your wife has diabetes.  Please discuss the dosing regimen with your treating physician on a regular basis and make sure your wife checks her readings at least when she wakes up in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal.  She should also write down what she eats, so her doctor can also know if any changes need to be made in the diet. I hope this information was helpful and answered your question adequately.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am a vet tech at a small animal hospital. I was scratched during a dog nail trim a week ago. It has almost fully healed but now I m getting sever pain in my arm from the elbow to my hand, on the bottom side (sensitive ski. Area) is there any concern from the scratch or is this something totally different? No swelling and no rash.","Hi, Thank you for contacting us. I will to ad Chat Doctor.  The single most important thing to rule out here is an infection. Antibiotics are prescribed for bite wounds to prevent infection in certain situations. For example, if:1. You have been bitten by a cat. All cat bites are usually treated with antibiotics, as they are much more likely to get infected than dog bites.2. The bite wound is on an arm or leg - especially a hand. These sites are particularly prone to nasty infections that can cause severe damage after a dog or cat bite.3. The wound is large, deep or punctured. A puncture wound may not look large but may go deep into the tissues.4. Your injury needed an operation to clean it out, or repair the damage.5. Your resistance to infection is low. For example, if you are on chemotherapy; have no working spleen; have diabetes; have an immune system problem such as AIDS.6. You have an artificial heart valve (and sometimes, if you have an artificial joint). Antibiotics will also be prescribed if your wound has already become infected. It might be infected if:It is getting more painful rather than improving as time goes by. It has become red or swollen. It is oozing. Sometimes the doctors exam will discover some red lines in the skin of the arm - this is known as lymphangitis - this also needs antibiotics. Best to get this checked by your doctor as soon as possible. I hope this helps. Please message me back if you have any further questions. Best wishes and I hope you get better soon.A"

My name is Cathie, i m a 56 y.o. woman, caucasion, obese, and I suffer from Type 2 diabetes x 20 yrs., chronic depression and chronic pain. Lately I can t sleep.[1-2hrs/24 hrs,] my major symptom is a twitchy, spasm all over my body. do you think you could tell me what is happening?","Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the twitchy spasm all over your body may be a disorder called myoclonus or myoclonic jerk. It may be caused by different problems like : seizures, diabetic amyotrophic or polineuropathy. It is very common during sleep, in patients with diabetes. I would recommend monitoring your blood glucose better, and have an Electroneurography and an EEG to exclude the above-mentioned disorders. If I were your doctor I would recommend treatment with clonazepam. It is a very effective Chat Doctor.  Other therapy I would recommend would be Pyrimidine, L'Oréal etc. Hope to have been of help!

I understand your concern and would explain that his symptoms could be related to blood pressure fluctuations. It is important to investigate for the possible causes of these blood pressure fluctuations. For this reason, I would recommend performing some tests (if you have not performed them yet): - blood electrolytes- PCR, sedimentation rate for inflammation- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- a Head Up Tilt test for possible orthostatic hypotension. Considering the fact that he has been smoking for such a long time, I would also recommend performing a Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries. Hope you will find this answer helpful!

He looks like he lost weight also. He coaches ice hockey(28) yrs. And can t tolerate the cold. I am wondering how concerned we should be. He is only on cholesterol medication.,"Hello,,, at 60 yrs fatigue with loss of weight, is a point of concern. You need to have him tested for diabetes and thyroid straight away. Then a general health check for not so common problems. Also, let him stop the cholesterol tablets for a month and see how he feels. This tablet can cause muscle pains which may be interpreted as weakness. Also, consider adding It D, Vitamin B1B6B12 along with Zinc as tablets. A general health check up with an X-ray chest would be essential."

Following the crainiotomy I had 30 radiation treatments. About 10 years ago, I began having petit mal seizures, which my doctor said are caused by the scar tissue from my operation and radiation therapy . After trying every anti epileptic medication I am currently on Felbatol and Onfi. In October I experienced a different type of seizure becoming basically numb on 1 side of my body. I went to the hospital: One of the doctors said I may have had a stroke and another said I suffered from Todds paralysis . I went for an MRI and my friend who is a doctor said the results sounded like a stroke they saw a new white spot on my scan. My corrodoted arterty test came back ok and the EKG they did in the hospital was normal. I just went for both tests again.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. It is good to note that you have no recurrence of astrocyte, after surgery and radiation therapy, nearly three decades after the initial diagnosis and treatment. Your current symptoms are due to a small stroke, as per the new MRI. Treatment is mainly with blood thinners such as aspirin.  In addition, any risk factors such as diabetes, high BP, cholesterol etc., should be looked for and treated, if present. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. "

Lets, start with understand what do we mean by ""POLYNEUROPATHY"", NERVES are like electric wire conducting the information from one point/ part to the brain and back, now nerve like electric wires have an insulation, but due to various reason the insulation layer gets withered and so the nerves will have issue concealing the information with the secure track (like short circuit as in case of electric circuit), and the information will be misrepresented as pain instead of mild touch or in matter of fact even heat can be represented by damage nerve to brain as PAIN. This is major issue in polyneuropathy, It's not yet possible to entirely replace the lost insulation of the nerve.

Your mother has an advanced stage of breast cancer and needs treatment targeted to the cancer spread. In this situation, the cancer cells might be controlled by chemotherapy and radiation. Her sugar levels are high and this can cause additional health problems during her treatment. Swelling of limbs might be an emergency like deep vein thrombosis. You should urgently consult her doctors and get a D dimer blood test and lower limb Doppler scan done to know if there are any clots in the deep veins of legs. This is an emergency and must be considered first. If she does not have DVT then the swelling of leg might happen when there is extra fluid collection in the limbs and this takes place in the tissues below the skin and is also called subcutaneous edema.

Short information about progress of weakness.*Explanation: My opinion is that high blood pressure on many occasions is an indication for control. That happens on many levels. First, be sure that high blood pressure is not secondary to any other diseases as Cushing or renal failure. Then, Diet with low salt and less fat content is crucial. Exercise and other healthy activities are also a mean to control blood pressure. If all that does not help, medications are a must. That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities. Some Chat Doctor. Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started. Weakness or neurological deficit in a hypertensive patient is a dangerous sign and need to be managed as soon as possible to avoid brain hemorrhage suggest my patients the following : lower blood pressure to a reasonable level, follow up conscious level and weakness. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about other comorbidities like diabetes, hyperlipidemia etc., also you didn't mention the fate of weakness or investigations done.*Conclusion: I suggest you consult your physician about your aunt antihypertensive medications.

Creatinine levels are dependent on muscle mass and exercise. 1.5 mg could be normal. Require further history of diabetes or hypertension or any renal related abnormalities to further confirm. Any further queries, happy to help again."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi,I am 31 year old and have 2 year old son. I was expecting my second baby in this june. Pregnancy went well till 38.4 weeks with all reports being normal. I do not have blood pressure or diabetes or any other health problems. Pregnancy went normal without any events. On 5th I did scan and babies weight was 3.0. Doctor asked us to take c-section date and we choose 14th june. Tuesday on 8th, I was feeling extremely tired and had cramps in my legs. I also was feeling less baby movements. I went to doctor and they checked heartbeats. It was 148. So, they told us baby is fine and come for final checkup on 11th. I went on 11th and doctor couldnt find babies heartbeats. What could be the reason for this? I had to take out still born child immediately with second c-section. Is it okay to try conceiving for second baby now? I had one cycle of my menstrual period in August. What kind of care should I take and what are the chances of getting similar even repeated? Doctor told me that there was blood clot in umbilical cord and so babies heartbeat stopped suddenly.Cheers,Shweta","Hello, I am very sorry for what you had to go through. Since you had a cesarean section just a couple of months ago, I would ask you to wait for a year before planning another pregnancy. This helps you to recoup, and the wound also heals in the meantime. The cause of the fetal demise is not a recurrent one. It calls for extra care during your next pregnancy in fetal monitoring. Please have a healthy diet and adequate rest. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

I get blurry vision and headaches for about 15min after hard workouts/races and become very lethargic for the rest of the day even after eating and drinking water. The ATs thought it was hypoglycemia so I ve been eating carbohydrates before races and intense workouts (which never do anything and I still have the same symptoms). I ve been checking my sugar after races/workouts and it is around 200-250 mg/dL. Coaches also assumed my fatigue may have been from anemia. Ferritin level was 15 and I have been taking iron and vitamin C everyday for 3 months. My fasting glucose is usually around 105-120mg/dL. Is there a possibility I might have type 1 diabetes?","Diabetes doesn't seem likely with those sugar numbers.  When your symptoms come on do you feel LIGHTHEADED at all, faint, or otherwise zoned?  Are you usually breaking a pretty good sweat when this all happens?  Are you cutting weight for your running?  Have they taken your orthostatic blood pressures?  Have they measured your BP's orthostatically when you feel this way?  Have you had blood work done, imaging study of the head, EKG, or a Holder monitor?  I am a neurologist and I also compete as well as assistant coach a varsity NCAA wrestling team here in Cleveland, OH, so I know a lot of these sorts of issues as related to our guys and every year at least 1 or 2 of them get into similar problems.  Of course, wrestling is a different sport from track and weight losses play a major role in our sport that can get people in trouble if they're not careful.  But across the board, HY Chat Doctor. You say you're anemic?  And you're taking iron?  But have they also checked magnesium levels?  If you have a magnesium level deficiency, and you are anemic...no matter how much iron you take you will never correct the anemia.....so little details like that keep people from getting better.  Of course, a bigger question for me is WHY ARE YOU ANEMIC?  You shouldn't be....you're an athlete, your diet should be top-notch, your sleep habits should be top-notch, and your training should be intensive but controlled and carefully overseen.

I am serious about lowering my test score. 8o,"Hi welcome to Chat Doctor. I have read your question and I have understood your concerns. Loss of protein in urine is a sign of kidneys damage in any disease, also in a diabetes. But the most important parameter is S. Creatinine and GFR(glomerular filtration rate). Please just see your reports and discuss with your doc about that parameters. My advice to you - 1. Avoid excessive fluid and salt at it will raise your blood pressure in kidney DISEASE. DON'T TAKE EXCESSIVE FRUIT JUICES - THEY SHOULD BE AVOIDED BOTH IN KIDNEY DISEASES AND DIABETES. SO restrict fruit intake. Up to early stages of kidney damage normal protein intake in diet is allowed. 2. Tight control of blood sugar is of utmost importance. Target will be FBS 3. Don't get panic, in early stages kidney diseases are preventable. Take regular follow up with your kidney specialist and do every 2 monthly blood reports for kidney and diabetes. Thank you."

After going through the history posted here it appears that the infection has not recovered completely.

As it F toxicity is known n off.  As for your lipid profile, the results are on higher side though not something you should be really worried of.  If you have no risk factors o would suggest lifestyle modifications, life cutting oil/fat in your diet, substitution with healthy oil like olive, supplements like omega 3 fatty acid flax seeds and otherwise.  RPT lipid profile after 3 months and if still higher than start a medication for it, in my practice I have seen patients becoming complacent when they see the cholesterol coming down with meds and make no effort to change their unhealthy lifestyle.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have sore muscles in my lower legs and feeling very tired. I do have type 2 diabetes but my blood sugars are not high or out of control. The feeling of fatigue is being to be overwhelming and the pain in my legs keep me from sleeping or getting rem sleep,"Hello, I read your query and I would like to say that Diabetes can cause weakness and loss of fitness. Having raised blood sugar levels sometimes after a heavy meal and occasional altered salt levels puts muscles at a disadvantage and they don't perform quite well. Also, with time as diabetes progresses, the blood supply to small nerves is lost and that nerve fiber dies. When the nerve serving a muscle fiber dies then the muscle fiber will also stop working. In addition, people with diabetes also have an increased tendency to narrowing of the arteries that is a condition called peripheral vascular disease which is caused by narrowing of the arteries, usually due to the build-up of cholesterol.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I was tested with a blood creatine level of 1.9. my 24 hr urine test was normal. My kidney ultrasound showed no blocked. Have I sustained any permanent damage. How should I manage my diet. I am a cycling enthusiast and engage in intense exercise.,"Thank you for your query. Creatine is found mainly in Muscles. Creatinine is a metabolic product of Creatine. Creatinine is removed from the body mainly by the Kidneys. For this reason, it has been used as an indirect marker for assessing renal function. Normally, an increase in creatinine above the normal range would indicate a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the kidneys functional units. The GFR determines, how effective the kidney is removing metabolites and maintaining homeostasis. For, sedentary to moderately active individuals, the usual lab values provide a good reference.However, in athletes with more muscle mass compared to the non athletic people, there is more creatinine in the blood to start with and may not necessarily indicate a decline in renal function. Diet rich in animal protein, protein or creating supplements, certain medications can all increase the level of creatinine in the body (either directly or by reducing its excretion at the kidney level). Serial serum creatinine levels and monitoring of other renal parameters will help to determine if you have a reason to worry. Try to eat a well-balanced meal and get all your nutrition from natural products rather than concentrated forms. Hy Chat Doctor. If you are on any medications, consult your doctor to see if it contributes to the elevated levels. Go for routine checks and monitor closely. If you have diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol levels, risk of kidney damage is present. Early detection will help prevent progression. Hope this helps.

They tried to treat it with lasers, but it didn t help. He had an MRI and the tech said there was a shadow that could have been from a mass or mini stroke. He never got to follow up with the doctor because he lost his health insurance. I don t think it was ethical for the tech to tell him anything and I m hoping if it was serious, the doctor would have called him. He has migraine or migraine-like headaches a lot, but he s also under tremendous stress from an ugly divorce. He said his eye gets worse when his stress gets worse. He said everything is wavy and when he looks at a person s face, he see black. Is this something that will go away in time and are headaches normal with macular edema? Thank you for your help.","If your Eye makes a macular edema diagnosis due to diabetes or retinal vein occlusion, focal laser treatment is often used to reduce swelling of the macular. With this form of laser surgery, your Eye M.D. applies many tiny laser pulses to areas of fluid leakage around the macular. The main goal of treatment is to stabilize vision by sealing off leaking blood vessels that interfere with the proper function of the macular. In some cases, vision loss may be improved with laser treatment. A patient may need focal laser surgery more than once to control the leaking fluid. If you have macular edema in both eyes and require laser surgery, generally only one eye will be treated at a time, usually several weeks apart. Medication injection therapy is also being used to treat macular edema. Two Chat Doctor. Anti-bug "

I am taking a 200mg capsule of lomexin...fenticonazole nitrate and i use verdal cream...my husband uses the verdal cream too","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor! I understand your query. Well there are several causes of recurrent infections. Primarily, your immune status may not be up to mark i.e. you might be having some immune deficiency. Ensure a proper balanced diet with good eggs and non-veg intake if you are a non-vegetarian, as they are a rich source of proteins. Soybean is also a rich source of proteins. You might want to get investigated to find out the cause of this immune deficiency. Another common cause of recurrent infections is Diabetes. I'd strongly advice you to get a fasting and post radial blood glucose test done to find out your diabetes status. Thirdly, are you sure it's a yeast infection? I'd suggest you to visit a gynecologist and get it examined to rule out any other condition. Hope this information helps. Feel free to ask if to have any doubt. Wishing you a speedy recovery.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I assume it is diabetic amyotrophy, or proximial diabetic neuopathy. My right leg would hurt when trying to get out of bed and laying flat usually makes my leg muscles hurt over time.

The muscle pain would go from my right rear-end, rear right thigh, behind the knee, and right calf. I ve been keeping my blood sugar between 130 and 180, but after learning 120 was the main number to avoid, I rarely go over 130 when I check it, sometimes just under 120 when waking up, rarely using my 1000mg metformin (afraid of my sugar dropping TOO low). Coughing and laughing would also hurt the leg I have this pain in. Is this really diabetic amyotrophy, or could it be something else?","Dear Sir/Madam have gone through your query and read your symptoms. In my opinion, your symptoms suggest a compression of disc in the lumbar region of your spine and is not due to diabetes, it would be better judged if you can get an MRI of your LS spine done, second thing is that numbness in whole foot, the stocking pattern is due to neuropathy, but numbness in any anatomical distribution like sole could be due to compression of nerve in the vertebra.

If this is caused by diet, obesity, and diabetes then dietary and lifestyle changes will be beneficial in every case.

I also experience pain near the sternum area. Im always suffering with nausea and lately ive been vomitting up clear stuff.","Hi, thank you for asking Chat Doctor I understand your concernsWith this presentation, I think you need proper assessment. The periodic chest pain you are experiencing may be from gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. An antacid and omeprazole could be of help. Concerning the swelling of feet, ankle and hand, I think your heart may be failing and not working proper (right ventricular failure). The numbness can be from a long term complication of high blood pressure, diabetes or electrolyte imbalance. You need clinical assessment and some tests like ECG, ultrasound of the heart, blood electrolyte panel, fasting blood sugar and kidney function tests.

Low is not zero. I will usually review symptoms of reflux (burning, sometimes meal related, often lasting longer than 30 minutes or occurring at rest) and musculoskeletal pain (positional and localized with a finger) and recommend a trial of over the counter heartburn aid. If the symptoms fail to improve, I will usually reassess and consider testing."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis in August and was sent for a HIDA Scan. Result was an ejection fraction of 9% at 30 minutes post sincalide, consistent with dysfunctional gallbladder and chronic cholecystitis. I was referred to a surgeon for removal of gallbladder. The surgeon ordered an ultrasound and found distended gallbladder with no stones. He advised against removal of gallbladder and ordered an endoscopic ultrasound which was performed two days ago. The results were normal, but now they want to follow-up with an MRI in 3 months. I am absolutely a non-drinker  , but my diet is not great. Also, I have iron deficiency anemia and my blood glucose level is somewhat elevated. I am on the brink of type 2 diabetes.  My primary care doc feels very strongly that the gallbladder should be removed, and I am very confused. The surgeon doesnt respect the HIDA Scan. He claims the test is unreliable because it can change on a daily basis. Is this true? Two of my three daughters have had their gallbladders removed. The oldest daughter had acute pancreatitis and had several ultrasounds, none of which showed stones, but did suggest sludge. She became very ill during her pregnancy and had to have gallbladder removed at 18 weeks pregnant. The second daughter had a somewhat different situation, and was found to have a non-functioning gallbladder, which was removed. Both daughters were seen by Cleveland Clinic surgeons, as was I.  I truly dont know who to believe, and the surgeon I consulted does not like to be questioned about his decisions. He has an excellent reputation, so I should probably follow his advice, but I dont want pancreatitis again. It was very painful and I was very sick for four days before I went to the ER. Couldnt take a deep breath or swallow without pain in the right upper abdomen and left lower back. Also had fever. Apparently the pancreatitis was in the tail of the pancreas. Help?","HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI think you are more concerned about pancreatitis than cholecystitis, now these are the lesions of pancreas and gallbladder, if the sign and symptoms are server and chances of recurrent of infection is there then you really need surgery, both organ can be treated surgically in one session, discuss it with your surgeon, HIDE is nuclear scan the over all imaging study report entirely depend upon the expert nuclear radiologist or nuclear physicist (Medicine branch) else the reports are highly changeable in comparison with conventional imaging, have nice day."

A thorough musculoskeletal assessment and neuromuscular assessment is advised. As you have the medical history of kidney failure stage 4, diabetes and hypothyroidism the reaction of tremor you are facing is because of the combination of the above. Due to the above contions there is a disruption in the neuromuscular channelling and leading to tremor, twitching, fatigue, cramps etc. The pathology is deep to understand, and the nerve gets disruption in the signalling leading to the symptoms.

Not many symptoms except perhaps intermittent fatigue (though had minimal symptoms with one successful pregnancy). Your thoughts re: rate of rise and absolute ChatDoctor values?

In my opinion the Chat Doctor value is increasing but at a slower rate. But Chat Doctor values cannot be taken as standard, and they are highly variable in two different people and for the same women in two pregnancies. So don't worry about TGE Chat Doctor levels. And coming to symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, sore breasts, increased urination they might be not be seen in a few people. So the status of pregnancy cannot be said just by basing on symptoms and Chat Doctor levels. But due to past history of miscarriages and slow rising Chat Doctor care should be taken. The causes of abortion during the first trimester are genetic anomalies, hormonal insufficiency like progesterone insufficiency, thyroid abnormalities, diabetes, uterine anomalies etc. should be ruled out.

What exactly are the side effects? He also has asthma and has had the swollen tonsils for 3 weeks.","Hi, Steroids reduce inflammation and pain due to any cause. They suppress all the immunity response of the body by inhibiting all the chemicals causing inflammation. Steroids are very useful in bronchial asthma. A short term use of steroid shots for 3 to 4 days may not cause severe side effects. Long term use of steroids for months can cause peptic ulcer, hypertension, diabetes and osteoporosis. Inhaled steroids can cause sore throat and oro-pharyngeal candidiasis. Hence, gargling of the mouth should be done regularly after using inhalers. Take care. Hope I have answered your question.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi! I have been experiencing progressive numbness of both of my feet, beginning with the right foot, over approximately 5 year period and now it seemes to have progressed to my right hand. I have also been experiencing vertigo, imbalance, and memory loss. About 3 months ago I had severe pain from my right hand, up my right arm and then over the shoulder and down to the end of the scapula area. An MRI of the cervical area showed herniations of the cervical discs and a rupture at c6-7. A recent Mri of the brain, for diagnosis for the above symptoms of vertigo, imbalance, memory loss, some ataxia, changing vision condition, showed an increased T2 and FLAIR signal present in the supratentorial white matter that likely represents mild chronic microvascular ischemia. I also have several symptoms that correlate with autoimmune diseases such as lupus, sclerderma, MS, and multiple connective disease. I have raynauds syndrome, and a history of thyrotoxocosis. Im having a really difficult time trying to find doctors that want to help me because of the multiple areas of my medical problems. The neurologist that ordered the MRI of my brain wont even call me back. Can someone please help me?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Your neck, shoulder and arm problems are due to the cervical nerve roots being pinched at multiple levels as seen on cervical spine disc herniation. The C 6 - C 7 disc rupture is significant and might cause limitation of neck movements. The MRI brain shows areas of T 2 hyperintensity in the supratentorial white matter. Since you have not mentioned your age and the images are not attached, it is a bit difficult to confirm if the findings can be acceptable at your age. Microvascular ischemia is a term for loss of blood flow through the small blood vessels in brain leading to decreased oxygenation and tissue damage, these changes can also occur in people with diabetes and hypertension. Autoimmune conditions can also show certain features, but your MRI does not fit in to a single category. MS will show a definite pattern on MRI and I think your doctor has ruled out this condition by clinical features and MRI scan findings."

The cheating therapy surely helps but not always (and not completely). If this is your case, then Foliose might help with postprandial blood glucose but it won't target the source of your problems which is (presumably) insulin deficiency due to pancreatic destruction. If insulin is really missing you should take it regardless of the blood glucose levels to prevent serious complications like ketoacidosis. Foliose is usually given to type 2 patients who have an almost adequate insulin production. Your doctor is the right person to investigate (by evaluating your history and laboratory tests) whether your diabetes is type 1 or type 2 and modify your treatment accordingly. I hope I've helped!I'll be glad to ask any further questions you may have. You can contact me again if you'd like! Kind Regards!"
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Thank you. I got a call from my mom because she has been experiencing pain behind her knee. When I went to assess, there was swelling and hardness that covered about 3 x2 behind the knee. (Hard upon pulsation) It did not feel like the hardness had an exact shape or form, (like a bakers cyst) Now, there was about a half inch line of what resembled a bruise. Almost reminded me of varicose vein, but this just appeared 3 days ago. She was hoping it would go away, but there is a bit of redness around the bruised line area. She was feeling like something had bitten her, but its hard to tell. Any suggestions that could explain the sudden hardness, and pain? I assessed for DVT by having her flex foot and checking for pain in calf, but I m not sure at all what it could be. She was diagnosed with diabetes 1 year ago, and is diet controlled.",Hello have read your query. There is possibility of DVT. I will advise you color Doppler of calf. Till time take neurotrophic medication like methylcobalamine. Another possibility of knee osteoarthritis. Physiotherapy like ultrasound and Tens may give you relief. Bruising can be due to associated skin involvement. I hope I have answered your questions. If you have further questions please feel free to contact us. I will be happy to answer. Take care.

This type of infection are more common in patients with reduced immunity like diabetes. If you are uncircumcised you may have fibrosis which is a discharge from a fungal infection under the foreskin. This can be treated with good cleaning of the penis with a gentle soap and water as well as an antifungal powder. I would suggest you to follow1. Proper hygiene and regular washing of prepuce is useful for the prevention of balanoposthitis.2. Topical antibiotics like metronidazole cream and antifungals clotrimazole cream.3.

Thanks. Rithwik","Hollowed this carefully and you will get the answer. Normal fertility is associated with sperm counts of> 48 million/mL (in your case it is 190 million/mL, but volume is only 0.5 ml (while normal quantity is 3-6-8 ml ),with a motility of >63 %(in your case total motility active and sluggish is 45 %)with >12 % exhibiting normal morphology (normal in your case). Normal pus cells are 2-5 (in your case it 12- 14) and RBC's 1-2 (in your case 10-12) . Glucose random is normal but upper limit, so for this I advise you get in blood for HBA 1 C examination and also repeat the blood sugar level for 3 consecutive day to rule out diabetes. Get in blood for sugar level first, thereafter consult infertility specialist. So in my opinion consult an INFERTILITY SPECIALIST and get his opinion. Good luck."

For primary prevention, you can reassess your risk factors and then decide whether to take aspirin. The side effect of low dose aspirin is very few. Peptic ulcer gastritis is one of them.

Secondly Can I take  Glycomet 500 SR in place of Glycomet 500","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have read your question completely and understand your concerns. Your Fasting blood glucose and post radial blood glucose are still high. For good control of diabetes, your fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 and your post radial blood glucose should be less than 160. I would advise you to get your HbA1C levels also checked. This is a blood test which tells you your average blood glucose over the last 3 months. For good diabetes control, it should be less than 6.5% provided you are below 60 years of age and without any other health problems like recent heart attack, stroke etc. For better control of your blood glucose levels, I would advise you to increase your Glycogen dose. Take Glycogen 1000 mg twice a day, at breakfast and dinner time. you could take Glycogen SR 1000 mg as well. SR means Slow Release tablets, the side effects with SR medication are lesser than with conventional tablets. Kindly check your fasting and post radial blood glucose levels in 2 weeks. I would advise you to follow a healthy diet with plenty of vegetables, reduce the quantity of carboy Chat Doctor.  Avoid high fatty, high sugary and high calorie food.

Managed to get strength to go to work and they made me eat chocolate to bring up sugar levels. Nearer the end of the day I got pins and needles down my left arm . I spoke to my dr before the pins and needles and he said to have a blood test which ive booked for monday! This scares me incase its diabetes or anemia. My mum s mum is diabetic and so is my dads dads? Im 18 by the way,"Pins and needle sensation is paresthesia .it is caused by many causes. Mostly occurs due to decreased blood supply transiently .it may be due to compression of the blood vessel, or metabolic. If u have had a good mattress/sleep than compression is ruled out. So it can be metabolic, it can be type 1 diabetes, at your age, but it manifests early in childhood. Mody can occur at your age given history. But, simple blood test can rule out this disease. The possibility of other metabolic conditions is more likely given acute onset. It can be hyperkalemia, or hypokalemia where paresthesia is common.Also, it could be any pathology in cervical vertebral region. So an MRI can rule it out. Metabolic conditions can be diagnosed by blood testing."

Am I diabetic ? Should I take medication or can it be controlled by diet/lifestyle changes ? Thank you for your kind attention - A. Sen Gupta, Bangalore, India.","Hello Sir, Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns. Based on the reports, you do have diabetes. For good glucose control your HBA1C should be less than 6.5%, your fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 mg/do and your 2 post meal glucose should be less than 160-170 mg /DL (provided you are fit and fine and do not have any other debilitating illnesses). I am not sure of your age. As your sugar levels are borderline you could try 3 month trial of diet and exercise alone to control your glucose levels. After 3 months measure the blood tests again. If they have reduced then you can continue the same healthy lifestyle changes and keep checking your blood glucose levels every 3 months. If your blood glucose levels have not changed or have worsened after the 3-month trial of diet and exercise then you need to start medication along with your lifestyle changes. Healthy lifestyle tips:1) Exercise-moderate exercise like brisk walking, cycling, swimming etc. - for at least 45-60 min every day or at least 5 out of 7 days in a week.2) Diet: Avoid sugary food items and sweets, cookies, chocolates etc. take plenty of vegetables (restrict potatoes). Take whole grains products like wheat bread, oats, millets, brown rice etc. Avoid refined /plain flour items. You can take 2-3 servings of fruit(avoid mango, jack fruit, custard apple, chick). Take adequate protein (eggs, pulses, non veg- but restrict mutton). Can take 5-7 nuts like almonds, cashew nuts etc. Restrict saturated fats like butter, cheese, paneer etc. 3) Reduce weight if you are overweight. I wish you well.

Usually IVF is suggested to those who are not able to conceive naturally. But in your case the pregnancy occurred naturally both of the times, but first one got terminated due to ectopic and 2nd one due to miscarriage. The cause for ectopic cannot be pinpointed, but the miscarriage might be due to genetic anomalies or hormonal insufficiency like thyroid abnormalities or progesterone insufficiency, diabetes etc. So I suggest you to rule out thyroid abnormalities, diabetes etc. Also give a gap of 3 months for next conception. And start taking folic acid tablet starting one month before planning the pregnancy. And as you are 36 years get screened for Down syn Chat Doctor. Nothing to worry. Untoward effects might not repeat in further pregnancy. Relax. Avoid stress. As stress also might hamper the normal hormonal balance in body leading to untoward effects. Hope this helps.

I m to undergo a laminectomy this coming week, T12-L1 and L1-L2. I m 55 years old, 5 10 and weigh 260lbs. I feel as if I am in relatively good health although I do have diabetesII and have had prostate cancer . I work in steel a mill, operate a remote control crane and generally on my feet for 12 hours a day. How soon should I be able to return to work?","From your description I understand that you are going to undergo a laminectomy, and you want to know about the recovery from the operation. I will try to explain the various stages of your recuperation. Usually after an uncomplicated laminectomy you might have to stay in the hospital for 2 to 5 days. This might increase if you have any complications like bleeding or infection. After discharge in the first two weeks you might have to deal with severe pain(for which you will be given painkillers from the hospital) but inspire of this you have to walk a little to reduce the scar tissue and prevent a large amount of scar tissue putting pressure on the nerves which were released by the laminectomy. You might have to visit your doctoring the third or fourth week for a review. Usually if no complications occur you can go back to work after 6 weeks. The idea here is to start walking to reduce the scar tissue from your operation and keep your lungs and heart in good shape. The later you start walking the more time you will take to go back to work."

There are many causes for the atrophy like age related and Alzheimer's dementia. Usually, there will be other problems like forgetfulness and difficulty in carrying out daily activities. Since your mother is aged only 50 (age related atrophy is unlikely) and has complaints like difficulty in walking and talking, a detailed evaluation is necessary to rule out brain damage due to minor strokes (hypertension and diabetes mellitus are risk factors). Unfortunately, if the problems are indeed due to atrophy, chances of recovery are less. The priority will be to prevent further deterioration."

Unfortunately, not having a family history of eczema or psoriasis does not entirely exclude the possibility that you have those conditions. However, those are not the only possibilities.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My dad has type 2 diabetes. He recently has been discharged from the hospital. He was prescribed ciprfloxacin 2 times a day, metroNidazole 3 times a day, & metroFormin 2 times a day. Today when I checked his sugar levels they were high (289). He has been complaining about a nauseous feeling in his stomach. Do I need to take him to Emergency ?","HelloThanks for usingChatDoctor for your health problems. I read careful your question and understood your concern. You doesn't explained clearly why your dad was prescribed the antibiotic and antimicrobial therapy anyway I presume that it has an infection when he was discharged. The infectious disease and maybe the psychologic stress that is caused by the infection can raise the blood glucose in a diabetic person. His blood glucose is high and nausea can be a symptom of diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when your body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. For this reason my advice is to check his ketone level in the blood and in the urine. If the result is positive you need to take him in an Emergency Room as soon as possible because it can be dangerous if it is not treated. In most cases, people with diabetic ketoacidosis need to be treated in hospital. If the test of ketones in his blood and urine is negative, i suggest consulting an endocrinologist in your area because in my opinion the metformin monotherapy is not effective, and it is necessary to add another antidiabetic Chat Doctor. I want to remember that the diabetic diet and more physical activities(if not contraindicated)are other important elements for the control of your dads' diabetes. I recommend to not be negligent. Hope I have answered to your question. If you have further queries, feel free and ask.

Incomplete data like age, gender, any associated medical problem like diabetes, duration of antifungal (Terminating) treatment?? To be effective, Terminating should be taken for 6 to 12 weeks. The result of successful treatment will be seen until the nail grows back completely. It may take 4 months or longer to eliminate an infection. If you did not notice any response even after 4 months, it may be due to ineffective treatment or resistance to Terminating. In that case other medications like Itraconazole tablet or antifungal nail polish containing Ciclopirox would be more effective. Besides, your nail should be trimmed properly this helps reduce pain by reducing pressure and the Chat Doctor. Any underlying cause like diabetes should be controlled with the medications.

Can you help with why Shechal was prescribed & will it be okk to take it..,"Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! You should know that Shelcal-CT is a Chat Doctor.  It is really helpful in case of osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. But, I don't think that the tingling in her right thigh is related to such disorder. As she suffers from diabetes, it is very likely that her symptoms are caused by a peripheral nerve damage, probably a mononeuropathy or a pinched nerve. For this reason, I would recommend performing a nerve conduction study. If the diagnosis is confirmed, I would advise starting treatment with Gabapentin or pregabalin, to help improve her situation.

He started with itching on his forearm & top of hand about a week ago and then followed tiny bumps you couldn t see unless you really looked closely..Shortly after his chest,arms,legs,tops of feet,and hands were covered in what looks like a rash of some sort.. His hands are the worst.. He has tiny bumps that are filled with clear fluid and come in groups or single spots.. He says they do not hurt just feels really gross.. I have had scabies before and they look NOTHING like that.. We went to the ER today and the doctor told him it looks like a food allergy and prescribed him prednisone and atarex .. I m not sure he is happy with the diagnosis so I am trying to get a second opinion","Hello, It is not common to develop a food allergy at this age although not impossible. If the rashes he had developed were definitely after eating a specific food (which must happen every time) then a diagnosis of rash secondary to food allergy is plausible. What you describe is something like cholinergic urticaria, a form of urticaria (this is not allergy in >80% of cases) that is triggered by temperature changes and mast cell release of mediators like histamine. Scabies is also a possibility that is intensely itchy and needs to be excluded with a careful examination, skin scrapings or a course of treatment if there is high clinical suspicion. Atarax is a strong antihistamine (sedative, so take at night) and prednisolone must be stopped after 5 days giving Atari a chance to work. You can switch to non-sedative antihistamines like fexofenadine or cetirizine. There is no blood test for a definitive diagnosis but thyroid disease or diabetes need to be excluded along with a complete blood count to ensure there is no infectious trigger. Hope that helps."

Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. I would like to tell you that the coronary artery disease has several risk factors. One of them, a strong one, is the genetic factor.

If you have learned how to do shoulder exercises then continue with that its could be effective. 5.

Let me know you if you will continue with smoking and alcohol then you are at high risk for liver disease. As far as abscess concerned you have taken antibiotic for one month. Now repeat the USG or x-ray to see whether it has resolved or not. If it is still there and looks like bacterial then it has to be Chat Doctor. If it is resolved then it will not lead much problem letter on life. But for that alcohol and smoke stopped. Rule out diabetes also as it can be related to abscess. Take low fat diet for few days.

My question is what is the best treatment for prostate cancer  since he  is 50 yrs old with diabetes?  By the way, he doesnt take med for his diabetes because its well under control.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your fathers situation and problem. Yes, prostate cancer if detected early and managed well, can have excellent prognosis and patient can have almost near normal life. Surgical removal of prostate (protector) is needed. Prostate cancer is hormone responsive cancer. And hence testicles are also removed (orchidectomy) along with protector. Post operative patient also needs hormone therapy to avoid recurrence.

Im 24 yr old circumcised male and for quite a long time after constant inflammation and meatitis (gone now), the skin right below the meatus (small patch, not the whole underside) ranges from slightly red to bright red and looks wrinkly/scaly. The redness gets worse after ejaculation. I must also point out that during urination, this area pouches out due to the force of the stream and I think because this skin is just weak/not much support in general. this causes my urine stream to be wobbly and not straight, however when i squeeze or hold this area during urination the stream is perfectly fine. The inflamed meatus has gotten better over the years and is pretty much healed, however it is just this strange looking patch of skin right below the meatus and the fact that it pouches out during urination that worries me. I have been to a urologist who said it was interesting and to come back if I need to. What do you think?","Hello share you concernLooking at your description it seems to be related to infection or inflammation of meathead I would like further information for better assessment like relevant medical history like diabetes or other hormonal disorderly recent exposure to unprotected sex?

After a CTScan and biposy he was diagnose with stomach cancer , at the stomach and food pipe junction. 2 weeks back he was operated upon, during which the entire stomach was removed. 5 cm extra radius was cut for biopsy , which suggested positive lymph nodes. Kindly help us with the best possible course of action that we could follow at this point if time. What are your views about Ion - beam therapy? What are the success rates? What other course of action do you suggest?","I am assuming that your father is in a good general condition and does not suffer from any comorbid conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc. Also, since you have not mentioned it, I assume that the cancer had not spread to any other body part and that the biopsy report shows adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer). If the margins of resection in the biopsy report are free from tumor then I would suggest your father to undergo further treatment in the form of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment in which we give special injections into a vein. These injections then kill the remaining tumor cells in the body, although they have a number of manageable side effects. Since your father has node positive disease, further chemotherapy is mandatory. However, if the biopsy report says that the margins of resection are involved by the tumor, then I would suggest a course of radiation therapy along with low dose chemotherapy (to increase the effect of radiation) followed by full dose chemotherapy. All this treatment should preferably be undergone at a dedicated cancer care unit."

Also getting worse feel shaky & jittery--thought I had diabetes. Canyou tell me what I have?","Hi. Thanks for the query. It looks like you have injured your jaw joint as you said that you have fallen on your right TMJ. It can cause jaw joint dislocation, damage to the soft cushion that is present between the two bony ends of the jaw joint, fractures etc. Feeling shaky or jittery can be due to anxiety or panic attacks however it can also be related to other causes for which you need to get thoroughly examined. For jaw joint related problem it would be better for you to consult an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated. A Panoramic x-ray should be done for ruling out the exact cause.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi. I had an MRI performed and the conclusion was: Single sub centimeter T/2FLAIR hyper intense focus in the left frontal peri ventricular white matter. Differential diagnostic considerations include a single demylwlineating focus versus sequels of small vessel ischemic disease. Clinical correlation recommended. 2. Otherwise, negative non contrast MRI evaluation of the brain. What does this mean? My doc basically sent me to the cardiologist for further treatment. I had fainted for the first time in my life was why the testing was done. Thank you for your time.","It would be useful if you told us your age as well. The older you are, the more likely is small vessel ischemic disease rather than a debilitating focus. Demielinating diseases are a group of diseases of which the most famous is multiple sclerosis, highly unlikely if you are over 45, so since your doctor seems not to think that is the diagnosis I won't elaborate more. By sequel of small vessel ischemic disease, it means a small stroke, what we call a lacuna. It means a small blood vessel is narrowed till it was closed and the small brain area it supplied was damaged due to lack of blood. In itself it may bring no major consequences if not in a critical area, but small vessel disease is almost always a more spread disease, meaning more blood vessels can be affected and cause accumulative damage over time. There are multiple causes of small vessel disease, but in most people the main culprit are factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, obesity. So the best preventive treatment is ad Chat Doctor. I don't know why you've been sent to the cardiologist, perhaps to be evaluated for your blood pressure, or perhaps to check for a cardiac origin of your fainting, like abnormalities of heart rhythm or other heart structural abnormalities. I don't think the fainting was directly caused by that brain focus, it is an incidental finding."

Sometimes we have to get out of the car and park in random places so that she can urinate. Sometimes, she would say that she doesn t have the need to do it. While a couple of seconds before she cried because of the need to go to the bathroom. She doesn t take any medication and is a very healthy child. what can it be? Is this something I should worry about?","Dear parent, Many thanks for your question with Chat Doctor .com.  There are many causes for frequent urination in a child.  The most common cause is behavioral.  She may have just got used to going to the bathroom regularly, and you may have to gradually encourage her to increase the time between visits until she increases her ability to hold her urine. However, before you can label it as a behavioral problem, you have to rule out the other, more serious causes of frequent urination.  For this she will need a few tests at your family doctor.1) You need to rule out a urine infection - for this she will need a urine test. 2) You need to check for diabetes - the symptoms of this are usually frequent urination, thirst and weight loss.  For this she would need a urine and blood sugar test.3) You need to check that her bladder and kidneys are all structurally normal.  For this she would need an ultrasound scan.  If the results of the above are all fine, you can then be reassured that it is nothing to worry about, and just work on her gradually increasing the amount of time she can hold her urine. I hope this helps you, good luck with the tests.  If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact me and if you found this helpful, please leave a rating!"

Increased SGPT may be due to hepatitis, altered lipid profile, autoimmune causes, medicines etc. In your case, increased SGPT is related to dyslipidemia. You need clinical examination and few other investigations. You need few more investigations like random blood sugar(RBS), renal function test(RFT), complete lipid profile, viral markers, complete liver function test, urine RE/ME. You should avoid red meat and high fat milk products. You should avoid fried and junk food and avoid alcohol completely if you take it. Medicines should be prescribed after complete investigations. I suggest my patients to take tablet ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice daily after food for three months. This help in regeneration of liver cells. I also suggest taking tablet atorvastatin 10 mg and fenofibrate 16o mg at night after dinner. It will correct lipid profile. Fatty liver is a reversible condition, and it may take 2-3 months for complete recovery. Get well soon. Hope I have answered your question. Take Care Chat Doctor. "

Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concerns. During diabetes, especially in subjects that have poorly controlled diabetes, it comes at a moment that small vessels of the body and nerves become affected. Therefore, it is not surprising that a diabetic patient lacks the specific symptom of coronary artery disease - angina. Instead, these patients more likely tend to have non-specific symptoms, such as dyspnea (shortness of breath), sweating, Chat Doctor.  I will not go on and say that this is definitely coronary artery disease, but there is a chance it is. So, I would recommend you to go to the clinic, with or without these symptoms, have an EKG, echocardiogram and a cardiac stress test, eventually a coronary angiogram. If you are diagnosed with coronary artery disease, proper treatment should be undertaken immediately. I hope I was helpful. Best regards."

Your SGPT of 96 is significantly high. The most common cause is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and it is confirmed in your case.

The latest taken last October was H1bc 4.7 and C-Peptide 3.01 taken at Appolo HYD. My lipids are quite normal except triglyceride which is fluctuating between 140-180.

Again I got it yesterday and it continues today as well. I feel discomfort at the calf muscle and a slight burning sensation on ankle area while I walk. There is no shooting pain nor tickling pain but a feeling of discomfort in both legs especially below the knee at the calf muscle. I have no pain during sleep. The discomfort starts only after I woke up form bed and start moving. Thank you","You are having a vascular claudicationhere are the factors specifically in your case)1) diabetic vascular problem - decreased blood circulation especially at the lower extremities2) calf pain at walking - this is an effect of number 1, when you walk, the blood and oxygen demand of your muscles increases, considering the fact that you already have a limited blood supply to start with BEC of number 1, you start to feel an ischemic pain (pain in any part of the body due to lack of oxygen carrying blood, the supply of your blood, cannot cope up with the increased demand of blood during walking only)3) relieved by not walking on it (decreased oxygen and blood demands of muscles, hence no pain)4) burning sensation (is a sign that a nerve is also not getting enough blood supply)here is on practical tip you can do by yourself to confirm your problem try using a stationary bike and use it for 15mins. Are the symptoms similar? If yes then that's your answer right there. You indeed have it. Next what to do. Well it's an expected part of having diabetes. Exercises strengthen muscles and train muscles to function with less oxygen and helps muscles to work better despite impaired blood flow in your legs.  As a result you will be able to do more with less pain and be more active with an overall increase in health and well-being.  Exercise will help in controlling your blood sugar and blood pressure, which will aid in decreasing your likelihood of developing more severe Peripheral Vascular disease"

I would appreciate any help with this.,"Hello, Medicines can cause bad breath while at times it can be secondary to Chat Doctor. It can also occur due to a number of causes like poor oral hygiene, oral and dental infections, post, sinusitis, reflux, respiratory infections, and diabetes etcetera. You should consult an Oral Physician or an Otolaryngologies and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigations depending upon suspected cause can help in diagnosis. Treatment of underlying cause will relieve the symptoms. As of now, you should start gargling with a flavored mouthwash twice a day. You should chew flavored sugar-free chewing gum. Do warm saline gargles twice a day. Limit the intake of high aroma foods like onion and garlic. "

Gastric Bypass 7 years ago (450 lbs - lost 263, gained back 100)","Hi, There can be various reasons for numbness of your right hand. Definitely, it can be due to vitamin B12 deficiency (quite likely since you already have a history for the same). However, there are other reasons like cervical disc diseases (neck related problems), carpal or cubical tunnel diseases (local compression of the nerves) or tennis elbow (local damage to muscles and tendons). Even diabetes and thyroid related problems can also cause such symptoms. Since you also have problem with equilibrium then we need to look for ear and brain (infections and swelling) diseases also. Basically, we need to have a detailed evaluation to find the reason for the same. I feel first take care of your diet - good balanced diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. For non vegetarians' food like animal liver is good source of vitamin B12. In vegetarian diet also many cereals fortified with vitamin B12 are available. You can even start taking some multivitamins. If still the symptoms persist then you need to go for some investigations like complete blood count, vitamin B12 levels, TSH and sugar levels and if further required ENT check up and brain imaging (CT head).

I have gone through the details given, and I do understand your concern. I have following few suggestions: 1) You will have to give a re-look at your diabetes treatment.

I have tried all over the counter (claritan, zyrtec, etc) as well as homeopatChatDoctoredications and nothing works. I have seen many allergists that tell me that taking steroids for the allergies would be worse due to elevated blood sugars but they are the only thing that works (i tried them many years ago after begging and pleading) I feel as though my sugars are more out of control due to the persistent chest, nose, eye, etc problems caused by the allergies. Do you think it would be impossible to find a doctor to prescribe a type one with an a1c of 7 some steroids for seasonal allergies? Also do you really think it is more dangerous to take steroids and have my allergy symptoms go away rather than live with highs due to the symptoms? thanks!","Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. I would like to know about your symptoms in detail like since how long, how often, what are your nose, eye, chest symptoms, which medications you used, which forms of steroids you used, dose of insulin for type I diabetes, any other medical conditions, any other medicines, your previous reports, etc. etc. This will help me to understand your complaints better and to make more specific suggestions for you. As you have chest symptoms, I would definitely like to know whether you have asthma, since when, inhaler use, etc.2. As long as nose/eye symptoms are concerned, I usually prescribe my patients' combination of levocetirizine + montelukast regularly.3. Regular steam inhalation also helps in a long run.4. I would like to mention here that there are many forms of steroids available, tablet, intranasal sprays, inhalers, etc. Most side effects, including weight gain, increased blood sugar, etc. occur with tablet/oral form. Sprays and inhalers are very safe as compared to oral forms, and choosing appropriate form may help to ensure minimum side effects with maximum health benefit. 5. Of course, Chat Doctor. 6. For diagnosis of allergies, I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, pollen, molds, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help you to identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.7. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms.8. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.9. Regular physical exercise including breathing exercise and a diet rich in vitamins & minerals also will help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.

Can doctor explain to me more about the readings of my liver function test (SGOT/AST & SGPT/ALT) whether very alarming or not? What are the side effects of consuming Livolin Forte in the short & long term? Thank you. Hamzah Nassir.,"Hi I hope you are very well The alteration that you present in your liver chemistry according to ALT levels is a moderate elevation, with a hepatocellular pattern. Your diagnosis may actually be a fatty liver, however, this is a very broad spectrum that includes hepatic stenosis and steatohepatitis. You have metabolic risk factors for fatty liver such as your overweight / obesity and dyslipidemia. You should have a checkup for suspected diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension. There are several non-invasive studies to evaluate the degree of fibrosis or even cirrhosis, the one with the highest diagnostic yield is the transient cartography (Protest), however, to differentiate between stenosis and stenosis hepatic biopsy should be performed. The importance of detecting a steatohepatitis is for prognostic purposes, since the progression to cirrhosis is greater. The treatment indicated in these cases is mainly non-pharmacological, the loss of weight is fundamental as well as a modification in the lifestyle, a balanced diet, increase in the physical activity. An approximate loss of 5-10% of weight is suggested in a period of 6 to 12 months, this is associated with an analytical and histological improvement. There are very few Chat Doctor.  One of them is vitamin E in doses of 400,000 to 800,000 U / day especially in people who do not have diabetes mellitus.

But being a cardiologist and been in practice for 6 years I would never advise any of my patient however old/young and whatever risk factors they have; to undergo election or angiogram. Coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery are the real treatment options for coronary artery disease and people can live a long symptoms free life after a bypass or angioplasty. The bypass grafts as well as angioplasty stents last well for 10-15 years at least. Angiogram on the other hand is very unpredictable and insecure procedure. I would not advise you to do this.

Did you see a dietitian? I truly cannot answer your question without seeing the type of insulin you are on, your blood sugar trends and your food plan. If you were my patient, after assessing you and your medication, I could get a better idea of the issue. Your 2 hour pp is in range. I don't know if you are dipping too low and then overcompensating. Another reason could be the Dawn Phenomenon related to the shift in hormones during the evening. I do not know your routine, but your insulin may not be holding you as long as needed. To tease out the cause keep a log of your meds, blood sugar and meals for one week and ask your doctor if you need a med adjustment and a referral to a dietitian if you have not already seen one. A dietitian can go over a nutrition plan that work with your blood sugar to keep it stable and complications to a minimum. There is a lot to learn about avoiding future problems when you have diabetes, please make an appointment to learn more by talking to a dietitian. Respectfully, Kathryn Shatter, BS, MS,RUN"

There can be 2 reasons why the morning glucose level is high. One possibility is that your night dose is not adequate (we call it dawn effect). The remedy for this is that we increase the night dose of insulin. The other possibility is that your night insulin dose is very high than needed and because of that your sugar levels become very low in the midnight when you sleep and your body tries to compensate for this low sugar by breaking down complex stored sugars from your liver into blood. (we call this osmosis phenomenon). For this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. If this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. Therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. Regards"

It is an ongoing condition. The insulin need would rise gradually. Sooner or later, the dose of medicine being taken has to be modified. This occurs because the capacity of the pancreas to secrete its own insulin changes. As that happens, the lower insulin produced by the body needs to be supplemented by higher doses of insulin given externally. So you may need higher doses, and you can meet your dietician for modified doses of insulin. Alternatively, you can tell us the exact readings of sugars, and we may be able to suggest part of the modification. Best of luck, Feel free to ask another question."

I have been having  severe headaches. My  esr  increased from  35 t0 55 even when i had taken 250 mg proximexa  as advised by my doctor since he suspected infection. why did my esr increase after 3 days of antibiotics?","ESR is a nonspecific test indicating the presence of an inflammatory condition. This could be due to an infection or to many other causes. The inflammatory process and the change in ESR could be due to the infection and would occur regardless of antibiotic treatment- it is part of the bodies response to the infection. If the infection clears up with treatment, the inflammatory process will start to clear up, but signs of it such as the ESR may take some time to return to normal. The ESR is not useful for take the courses of an infection. Again, it may also be due to an entirely different condition from the infection, such as arthritis, lupus, response to injuries, etc. etc. Hope this helps."

Your Systolic pressure (133)is a little high. Diastolic pressure and heart rate is normal. Numbness, however needs to be further investigated, even though it does not persist. Moving clots in the blood supply of the brain can cause transient symptoms. This is a precursor for stroke which is not treated on time can lead to nerve damage and paralysis. - do you have any family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke? -do you have any other medical issues?or take any medications? -any other symptoms like giddiness, breathing difficulty, muscle weakness, headaches, palpitations, digestion troubles? -do you smoke or consume alcohol? I recommend :- a physician consult -assessment of risk factors and current status of heart, lung, vascular and kidney function. - blood tests (complete blood count, Thyroid panel, lipid profile, blood glucose panel, ) -carotid Doppler.  MRI angiography of brain if required -electrocardiogram and stress test. Please seek medical attention to catch any Impending stroke and treat early. I understand that without Insurance, costs can be difficult to cover. However, try to get a basic work up and assess risk.

In my opinion you should consult cardiologist and get done 1. Stress test 2. 2d echo 3. Coronary Angiography if required. You are having many risk factors for cardiac disease like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes etc. So possibility of either cardiac failure or coronary artery disease (CAD) is high.

It keeps happening out of the blue over and over.  I read online some folks talking about fibromyalgia, but I have never been diagnosed with it or had any of the other symptoms. Very healthy otherwise!  This just keeps happening.","Hello, and thank you for your question. Fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia.  There are several possible causes of pain just in the toe.  If there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe.  If this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. Pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid.  The pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. Pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. Pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as B12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. Fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis.  It usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". In my practice, I start with finding out as much as I can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else.  Then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. I hope that my answer to your question is helpful.  If you have any further questions, please check back with us.  I hope your toe is much better soon."

A HbA1C level of 6.3 is at upper limit of pre-diabetes. It shows that your diabetes is under satisfactory control, and you are taking medications oral hypoglycemic agents properly.

It started when I was about 18 and slowly got worse and worse and im 21 now,"Hi in regard to your query, you have mentioned that you had visited doctors and dentists, but you have not mentioned what did they say. Basically bad odor from mouth is of many reasons either because of poor oral hygiene or any systemic diseases like diabetes, liver insufficiency, kidney diseases etc... since you have mentioned something like dead I would suggest you check your diabetic status since you are healthy with your gastric status. I would suggest you to undergo complete health check up with your systemic status and make sure you are healthy and go for dental check UPP to confirm that your oral health is good too.

Affection to small blood vessels causes problems with retina, kidney and erectile dysfunction. Whereas large vessel affection invariably leads to improper blood supply to lower limbs. This along with peripheral neuropathy can make limbs feel cold, numb and there may be altered sensation. Plus due lack of blood supply and hyperglycemia wounds do not heal quickly, leading to serious consequences. To overcome this maintaining a strict blood glucose control with fasting closer to 100 mg, PP 160 to 180 mg & HbA1c%<7, is necessary. Plus if the problem is severe, causing intermittent claudication (severe cramps on walking), then a color Doppler test or angiography may have been done. But most important is strict blood glucose control. Thanks"

As the pain is in the lower part of the ribs on the thorough abdominal assessment is advised.

Whats wrong with me","Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. From the signs and symptoms you prescribe it is a possibility that you have a Pyelonephritis. That was also the suspicion in the ER. I would like to know if you did any lab or imaging studies or did in the ER prescribe medication for further treatment? I also would like to know your age and if you have any chronic disorders that would complicate the treatment like diabetes, chronic lung or heart diseases). This is important because if your diagnosis is confirmed, in some cases there is a necessity for hospital admission.  I recommend to you to do the following workup: urinalysis (with microscopic analysis), urine culture, CBC and ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder. Regarding the therapy, if the diagnosis is confirmed and if you will be selected for outpatient treatment, you require initially a vigorous IV or oral fluids, paracetamol for fever and a dose of parenteral antibiotic. Then you need an antibiotic therapy at least 7 days in uncomplicated cases and the recommended first line therapy is ciprofloxacin. I hope my answer was helpful to you.

My opinion as a chest physician is as follows:Chest pain that is related with breathing suggest a pleuritic chest pain. This pleuritic chest pain makes me thing that the spot in the lung is near to pleural surface. In the setting of blood thickening, that lung spot it can be a possible pulmonary infarction due to peripheral pulmonary embolism.

But I need to know what about other parameters like is he having sugar (diabetes)? Well if he is not diabetic then next is what about hypertension, cholesterol or any other medical history.? If he is healthy and this is first time something happening different from I suggest to check on his back pain. Is it coming from back to leg along with numbness and tingling sensation. If yes then his problem is at spinal level which is affecting the nerve coming from that particular level and so that he has pain and sensory changes at lower end of the leg where ever the nerve supplies. But if there are no symptoms of radiating pain then it could be something related to vascularity where his lower limb circulation might be affected. Now to have conformation on this there is physical test that is hold and squeeze his calf muscle and check about pain if he complains of pain then the test is positive showing abnormality in circulation for lower limb. However the conformation can be done only after Doppler test for lower limb. Here just with symptoms of redness in fingertip, fatigue, pain is not enough for any diagnosis it can also be related to simple fever where you will have similar symptoms.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi. I am female, 22 years old. I am very hygenic (I shower every single day, and sometimes even have a clear-water, no bubble bath, bath in the evenings too). I suffer from extremely sore, painful lumps on my vagina, and general genital area. They are raised and usually quite hard, as if they go deep down underneath the skin. Occasionally I can release fluid/puss from inside of them, but mostly I cannot and it does not look like they have a head on them. I have been on about 8 different courses of strong anitbiotics over the past 18 months and they do clear the lumps up, until 2 weeks later when they come back again. Ive also been prescribed aqueous cream and betnovate cream but neither seem to be doing anything. I have also had huge abscesses and had to have them cut out & drained in hospital under local anaesthetic. Quite recently I have noticed that I have lots of purple/blue bruises appearing in between my legs, high up on my thighs, on my bottom cheeks and further inside, but near to my vagina and near the outer lips of the vagina. They appear in clusters like a rash. Sometimes they appear on their own, too. I also have noticed bruises appearing on my legs (my left shin is extremely swollen like there is fluid inside) and my limbs regularly hurt, like a pulsing pain, until I have to sit down it hurts so much. My shoulders hurt, particularly my left one. I am constantly tired and feel so weak and such pains in limbs and all over my body that sometimes I feel like I could just collapse. Other symptoms include feeling dizzy, constantly thirsty, blurred vision, problems remembering simple things or instructions, intense electric-shock like pains in my temples and lower back of head, severe vitamin b12 and folate deficiences for no reason. I take folic acid although it isnt being absorbed in my stomach for some reason. I have to be given vitamin b12 injections every 8 weeks to prevent anemia.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...I am 25 weeks pregnant. (my background is:I am on limited activity and no sex due to an emergency cerclage put in at 19 weeks b/c I was 1cm. I am not working now and I do no heavy lifting or exercise to be careful). My problem is that lately I have been feeling very tired, I get short of breath and sometimes even sitting I get short of breath.","Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. This is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. So many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. In addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. Another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. Normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. If you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. Of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. If you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

Folic acid, a B vitamin, is involved in proper development of an unborn fetus and efficiency of folic acid has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of certain kinds of birth defects, called neural tube defects. Is recommended by the CDC (centers for disease control) that women planning pregnancy take at least 400 mcg (micrograms) of folic acid daily. This is the minimum nutritional requirement recommended for this vitamin during pregnancy. Folic acid can also be prescribed up to 4 mg (milligrams)per day for women who are at increased risk for neural tube defects. These people include women who have to take certain medications during pregnancy that deplete folic acid, a family history of previously affected infant with a neural tube defect, and other inherited forms of clotting disorders.However, folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning that any excess in your system be washed out in your urine and there are no harmful effects on your body or the babies if you are taking higher than the recommended dose. So 5 mg is higher than the standard dose for pregnancy, however it really will not do you or the baby any harm. If anything you can cut the tablets in half and still have the adequate dose for supplementation and prevention of birth defects. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes, "

It is important to assess whether he was in the right frame of mind when this behavior occurred. ADHD is usually not the cause for this. Possibly he may have been in low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) or high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) wherein his consciousness and judgment may have been clouded and hence he exhibited this disinhibited act, but there is no definitive explanation for this. Regarding the ADHD he must visit a professional psychiatrist or counselor and gauge how to maintain his focus and attention. In regard to the diabetes you must have a regular follow up with the endocrinologist and see whether his blood sugar has been controlled and whether he has ever had other times of altered judgment.

Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I carefully read your question and would explain that your MRI report indicates the presence of small strokes in both fronto-parietal lobes. These findings can be related to different disorders: - migraine - small vessel disease- an inflammatory disorder, etc. That is why, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical check up and some tests: - a cardiac ultrasound - an ECG Holder monitoring to exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia- a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical arteries to investigate for possible narrowing-blood lipid profile- PCR and sedimentation rate for inflammation- complete blood count for anemia-fasting glucose for diabetes. Meanwhile, I would recommend taking aspirin 80-100 mg daily. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings, "

Result for all of them was 4.8. I had another test a week ago. My result was 6.2. I had back pain, light fever, and abdominal crampings at the day of the test. How do you see this test result?",Dear patient Test done for you is level of glycosylated hemoglobin level which is indicator of long term sugar level in blood over previous 3 months. Constant high blood sugar levels leads to its deposition in red blood cells as glycosylated hemoglobin.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I woke up this morning filling good about 2 hours into the day i was cleaning house when all of a sudden I got real dizzy light headed an then the hole room started spenning I went an layed down but it continued for about 2 hours finally started letting up i still get light headed when i stand up for a little bit now my kneck up to the bottom of my head acks and I have bad head acks,"Hi, I am Chat Doctor. I have read your message. I think I can help you. A per the query, you have reported a sudden onset of vertigo that was started when you were cleaning the house that reduced but persisted when you lie down and gets more as soon as you get up. Now, sudden onset of any neurological symptom suggests a possible stroke. And therefore I suggest that you go to an Emergency room as soon as possible and request an MRI of the brain to make sure that there is no stroke. If there is a stroke, you will need to be initiated for the appropriate medications depending on the type of stroke and also the duration after which you manage to reach the hospital. However, you have not reported any other feature like weakness or imbalance. So there is a possibility that instead of having a central cause of vertigo like stroke, you may actually have a peripheral vertigo like benign positional paroxysmal vertigo.  There are simple medicine like betahistine that will need to be initiated. There will also be exercises like Brandt Zaroff exercises that the doctors/neurologist will need to teach you. However, since stroke is a more serious condition, and a condition in whose management time is a very crucial factor, I think you should get to an emergency service in a hospital that boasts of a neurologist as soon as possible. Once the stroke is ruled out, then the peripheral causes can be considered and treated. I have tried to make it as simple as possible. I hope that you benefit from the suggestion. Please get to an emergency as soon as possible. In the meantime, try to remain still and in bed so that the episodes of vertigo do not worsen. Avoid sudden jerky head movements. Please note, I have assumed that you have no cardiac issues, no diabetes, no hypertension or any other significant past history, as this has not been mentioned in the query. Best of luck, "

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have had cold hands all my life, and in general have been always on the cold side. I have had had back and sciatic related leg/foot pain issues for the last four years involving L4 region. I have been diagnosed with epilepsy 12 plus years ago - coinciding, time wise, with a stressful marital divorce. I question stress and or sleep apnea as a trigger, since the University of Cincinnati is studying a possible link to the apnea and epilepsy. I have been totally controlled for over 10 years with dilantin and Keppra (generic) and would love to get off medication, if not needed. Recently, I was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and wear an oral appliance which is working very well. Now recently, I am experiencing an increase in numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. Also, about six/seven years ago, I started having a series of skin eruptions - small, itchy, and crusty - occurring anywhere on my body, mostly on my trunk. They are more intense initially then subside yet leaving a small, permanent and crusty eruption which may flare up on occasions. A dermatologist diagnosed this as Grover s disease. My last blood tests were mostly normal except for a high good cholesterol reading, which my M.D. stated out weighed the overall high cholesterol reading. First, what is your opinion on the skin eruptions, and secondly, how might my other issues be perceived. My blood sugar levels have been fine over the years, yet I do wonder about type two diabetes particularly with the tingling extremities. I also wonder about a possible thyroid involvement, since the blood tests have revealed a borderline reading. No history in the family of either issue. My back issue has improved recently - curiously, as the tingling became more apparent. Connection? With the present state of hurry-up office visits, my questions are superfluously addressed. - frustration. Thank you for your opinion!","Hello, Regarding the skin eruptions, the diagnosis of Grover disease is likely, it has the characteristics which you mention.  However, I am afraid that it is difficult to express a decisive opinion without being able to examine them or at least some photos of them. As for the tingling and numbness symptoms they can be a manifestation of peripheral neuropathy.  It is unlikely to be due to diabetes as diabetic peripheral neuropathy generally occurs when there is long-standing confirmed diabetes, not as an initial sign.  Thyroid disorders may cause it too, but with a borderline result its unlikely.  An electrolyte panel is advised if not already done as alterations in magnesium, calcium or potassium levels may also be a cause.  If no metabolic cause is found I would advise nerve conduction studies to check for nerve damage.  If all is normal then peripheral neuropathy is less likely and anxiety should be considered as a possible cause. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, I took my first A1C test.  The results is 6.9%  My doctor wants me to retake the test next week.  I have a family history of diabetes.  Im 48 years old, dont smoke, 6ft tall and weigh 240 lbs.  I exercise at least 5 days a week mainly cardio - some strength.  And, I make good efforts at eating healthier meals.  My total cholesterol is always in a good range (140 MG/DL taken 3-23-17).  My HDL is 34 MG/DL. Should I be concerned so fast about this first A1C test?","Hello, Thanks for the query. HbA1c% is considered normal when it is less than 5.9%, between 5.9 to 6.4 % is considered as pre-diabetic. >6.5 % is confirmed diabetes. So your HbA1c% of 6.9 is showing that there is presence of diabetes. Therefore, it needs treatment.Further, looking at your weight and height it is clear that with a BMI of 32.59 kg/M2, you have grade 1 obesity. Your ideal body weight should be 182 lbs. That means you are over weight by about 58 lbs. This itself can be a major contributor for inducing diabetes. HbA1c% hardly changes in just few days. If you start treatment for diabetes then it takes about 3 months for HbA1c% to show the change.  My suggestion is, better to start treatment for diabetes in consultation with your physician or a planetologist. Plus follow all the dietary advise and consider weight reduction seriously. Thanks."

Still waiting for neurologist to give us diagnosis. Medical conditions: Cholesterol & diabetes is under control with medication from the last health check that was done few months ago. I hope this is not a sign of dementia . Could you kindly advise what other conditions could cause the same.","Thanks lot for posting your questions in this website. The problem in elderly individual is generally difficult to handle, and a given medical problem can have multiple causes. Regarding your father, if you are very sure that the problem has started very recently, a medical condition called as delirium needs to be ruled out. This is a medical condition which may present similar to your father, provided that the onset of illness is of short duration. As the causes of delirium are so many, your father would require blood tests to rule out any infections, altered liver functions, kidney functions, CT scan or MRI scan of brain to rule of any tumor/stroke which may explain his problem. The second part of the story is that this illness might have started earlier in a less severe form and might have worsened now. If this is true, a possibility of dementia is high on the card. My advice will be to get the blood tests, liver and kidney function tests, serum sodium, thyroid function including MRI Brain. If all these tests are inconclusive, he may be subjected to a detailed neuropsychological evaluation to see if he has dementia or not, and we can manage accordingly after establishing the diagnosis. The third part of the story in these types of cases is that a single patient can have both and if delirium is treated properly, he gets back to the previous state.

Any feedback would be helpful.,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension can cause coma. High blood sugar level can cause diabetic coma due to solar edema in brain. Uncontrolled hypertension can cause brain hemorrhage and coma. In your mothers case, hypoxic brain damage is another cause. She was having flat line twice. This means that her heart stopped twice. This might cause reduced blood supply to brain and hypoxic damage.

Please get his sugar fasting and PP levels and see if there is a need to treat them. He should avoid eating mangoes or other items which are known to give him more boils, he might be sensitive to them. It is common for people who get boils to have more when they eat semi ripe or artificially ripe or just any mangoes. Also, he should take bath with a proper medicated soap or at least need soap with antibacterial properties. Eat more veggies and avoid non veg food, oily and spicy food for sometime as it increases sebum production. You may put boiled need water (after it cools down) to his bathing water. This would also serve as an antiseptic and reduce boils. Encourage him to take more water and salad, this will help a lot.Don't worry, he will be fine and with time sack marks will also go away.

It is likely that your diabetes which was in latent phase so far has become overt now. Pregnancy is a diabetogenic condition. Therefore, please report to your Obstetrician and get your blood sugar investigated. If diabetes is detected, it needs to be controlled by either Insulin or by oral medicines.

Diabetes itself with or without high blood pressure. And anemia can cause all the symptoms you have described. Get your blood pressure and blood for hemoglobin checked. Accordingly, you may require treatment. If you are not taking iron-folic acid tablets, please start them. Consume high protein diet. Diarrhea with stomach pain can be due to amoebic dysentery or worms. Stools examination will clinch the diagnosis. Amoebas can be treated with Metronidazole or Secnidazole. If worms are found, you will have to take deforming medicines with Obstetricians advice as some of them can affect the baby. Most urgent step should be to get investigated for Diabetes.

I managed this one by myself through draining and applying Fucidin ointment and it receded in about a week.

Please Dr I need a satisfying and calming answer as Im afraid so much right now :(","Hi. Thanks for your query. The first and the foremost thing is that you are just 22 years and no cancers occur at your age. All these swellings are small boils/ abscess and will settle well with a small course of an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medicines like Ibuprofen. IT is definitely advisable that you go for the blood and urine tests to rule out anemia, infection and diabetes, which again I feel will be normal. It is best to apply liquid provide iodine to the affected areas as it practically kills all the bacteria, and you may avoid further infection lesions like this. Just do not worry.

Thank you for the query. Pilonidal cyst can not be treated with an antibiotic. The only thing that can be treated with antibiotic is an abscess due to infected colonial cyst. Moreover, an antibiotic can be given only in case of diabetes or weak immune system. Otherwise, abscess incision is the correct treatment. Please note that colonial cyst is caused by ingrown hair. This hair irritates surrounding tissues and lead to recurring abscess. To get it permanently cured you need to have the cyst removed by a surgeon. Please consult one with this issue.

After coming home we thought he was recovering well but on July 2 again he felt severe shortness in breath so when took to Siddhartha Hispital, Kakinad, Dr. Vamsi Krishna said that the lung infection came again and this time its fungal (previously he was treated for bacterial pneumonia) and so my dad was directly admitted into ICU with ventilators support. The ICU patient dies on july 12 and the reason Dr.Vamsi Krishna said is Sudden Cardiac Arrest and it can happen anytime. Other healtChatDoctorplications of my dad are diabetes and stints in chest. My question is if there is fungal infection that serious as to be admitted into ICU on July 2 why did the Dr fail to diagonise it when visited him on June 30 apart of weekly checkup? I felt the culture test for presense of fungal infection was done late and reports came very late on July 9.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion cardiac arrest can happen anytime on ventilated patient with diabetes and cardiac stents. So your father was a high risk patient and pneumonia made him worse. Fungal pneumonia is not commonly seen. It is suspected only if typical x-ray findings are there, not responding with antibiotics. So I think doctor first gave him antibiotics, and he poorly responded to those antibiotics, so thought of fungal pneumonia. And all fungi are slow growing, so culture report comes very late.

Your physician can better relate these two. Fall in the blood pressure cannot be related to placement of dental bone grafts or removal of wisdom tooth.

I do not know what type my aunt and uncle had but I know my father had type two. My uncle died from his diabetes, my aunt died of heart failure due to her weight if I remember correctly and my father died recently this past year but my family and I are not sure what from-the funeral home wouldnt tell us anything past natural causes but we believe he had another stroke. My father was 51, and my aunt and uncle were in their 40s. I have never had to wear glasses before this year. I have been diagnosed with astigmatism but I dont know what caused it. I have been getting sick more easily this year. Just these past few weeks I have been sick with so much stuff I cant even remember. Last week I threw up for a few days from what seemed like food poisoning and I was nauseous for the rest of the weekend and this past week I have been having random bouts of subtle abdominal pain. This summer I had a random bout of excrutiating abdominal pain. I dont know why. I did not have to use the bathroom, I had not eaten anything, I was not on my period, and I had not been in a fight or anything yet I could not even move without crying out in pain. I would just be lying still and it would feel as if someone was slowly twisting a dozen knives in my gut. After about 2-3 days it went away and has not happened again. Could any of this put me at risk for having diabetes at all?alth queries right now ?  Please type your query here...","Thank you for the question. To remove doubts and also for family history of diabetes, get blood sugar tested. It is unlikely that abdominal pain has anything to do with diabetes.

This certainly is not going to put you to any risk of diabetes.be relaxed and and do not overanalyze or link to family history, often things do not pass on to child Chat Doctor. "

I don t feel satisfied with information I have been given. Not sure what further questions to ask or whether I should ask for further investigations. Can you comment?","Hello Madam, I understand your concern. You have so far received standard tests for screening heart disorders. The LBBB has to be treated, since you have significant risk factors for heart disease in your case.-Family history of MI in brother.-Family history of type 2 DM.-H/o Gestational diabetes. This can make you prone to early onset DM. Patients with LBBB require complete cardiac evaluation, and those with LBBB and syncope or near-syncope may require a pacemaker. Probable causes of LBBB in your case are either an occluded coronary artery or intrinsic disease of the conduction system. Since Holder ECG is normal, primary conduction disorders can be reasonably ruled out. To screen for blocking coronaries, I strongly recommend Coronary angiogram-CAG and highlight the need for temporary or permanent pacemaker implantation. Check with your cardiologist if he shares a similar opinion. Post your further queries if any, Thank you."

Staphylococcal infection is the most common infection related to skin, and it also usually infect wounds after surgeries. The first medication which is given in staph infection is combination of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid. This medication covers the infection very well. But many times this infection becomes resistance to this antibiotic. In that case there are other medications. But a pus sample is tested in order to know which antibiotic is effective in such cases. That way we can give the exact effective Chat Doctor.  As far as you wound is concerned, it is important to know if you wound seems to be infected on inspection. Or do you have fever. If so then you need treatment and wound care would also be needed. IF you don't have these problems then there is nothing to worry about. As long as your blood sugars are continuously well controlled your infection will be also well controlled.

The Dr. thought she had 3 cholesterol blocked arteries, with surgery-the Dr. said that she had 3 split arteries & blood had dried and formedblockages. What could have caused this problem?  She hasnt had any previoous problems.","Hello welcome to Chat Doctor. Atherosclerotic heart disease is a multifactorial disease affected by genetic and environmental factors. The risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease are strong family history, obesity, smoking, male sex, blood pressure, diabetes, age, improper diet and many others. A combination of these factors lead to deposition of cholesterol in the walls of the heart vessels causing them to narrow. Narrowing of the artery decreases blood supply to the heart and hence the patient gets chest pain. Narrowing of the arteries critically also leads to stagnation of blood cells called platelets causing clot formation which you are referring here to Chat Doctor.  This can lead to a heart attack. A bypass surgery uses alternative grafts to bypass the blocks so that the blood of supply to the heart is restored. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good health regards"

He has also had loose stools runny nose and what seems to be an uri. He also has reactive airway disease. i have also had a wound appear on my neck this week and have had headaches. Could any of this be from mrsa?,"Hello, MRSA may cause damage to many organs, but the clinical picture of your son probably relates to a viral infection. MRSA can cause sinusitis which usually presents with headaches, nasal congestion and perhaps even fever. I could not tell by your description. Nobody could tell you, actually. Cultures are needed to diagnose infections by specific pathogens. Normally in cases like that, doctors do not ask for cultures. I could not also comment on your wound. This description is too vague to be assessed. It could be better assessed in a clinical encounter. If you could provide a good quality picture, it would probably help. In general, MRSA is not a common pathogen in normal individuals. Risk factors for having MRSA include MRSA carriers (MRSA can reside in their noses), hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients, diabetes, cancer, hospitalization, stroke etc. Of course close contacts can acquire MRSA from high risk patients. So the answer is that unless you have any of the above you're not likely to have MRSA. I hope I've ad Chat Doctor. Kind Regards!"

We met at a school, and I was helping fold up the rolling cafeteria benches. The metal was very hard. It has been bruised and swollen since the injury. I can walk on it. But, it seems a long time for such swelling to continue. I wondered if maybe I have some bone fractures, not complete breaks. It also affected the veins in my left leg, they are swollen like a varicose vein. I went to the medical clinic, and they think it was sprained. I have never sprained an ankle by hitting, it... only by twisting it. Inside left ankle by the way. I am 53, and while overweight... I am very active normally and walk several miles a week. I have a 2 story house. So, I am not inactive, or just dealing with mild arthritis. I do not have diabetes or any other health concerns.

One of the most common causes of chest pain and tenderness is musculoskeletal pain accompanying chest infection and chronic cough. As you are a chronic smoker that is a high probability. I suggest my patients the following : chest examination, chest x-ray would be helpful, colorful sputum is an indicator of chest infection. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about other risk factors and comorbidities like diabetes, etc.*Conclusion: I suggest you check up with your general physician.

I also wanted to ask should i see a doctorabout my breathe or a dentist","Hello, It is possible that there are digestive factors coming into play if you are sure that your dental health is optimal. Brushing your tongue should be part of your daily hygiene as well as proper brushing flossing and rinsing. Various rinses act as disinfecting agents and have a refreshing value after all other proper dental daily care has been completed. I suggest that you assess your diet and eliminate foods that are known to be associated with odors such as garlic. I suggest you look for triggers to this condition. A routine physical with blood test is recommended if you can not achieve a satisfactory result. There are some disorders such as diabetes which can affect your breath. Do you have any discomfort with your digestive track? Do you have any inflammation in the back of your throat? Sometimes a condition known as tonsil stones can contribute. Thank you for your inquiry.

The site of pain indicates the location of a chronically inflamed appendix or of the pelvic adnexa and also could be due to an asymptomatic UTI which has not been detected.

I understand that her wieight is an issue as well, but please answer the question. I was wondering this because she seems to be less focused and feel tired.","Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. Normal value of random blood sugar should be less than 140 mg/DL. If the level of sugar is between 140 mg/DL and 200 mg/DL, the patient is diagnosed with prediabetes. If the level exceeds 200 mg/DL, then the patient is diagnosed with diabetes. Fasting Blood Sugar (8 hrs fasting is required)- It is the first test performed to diagnose diabetes. The normal range for people with no diabetes is lower than 100 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/DL). If the level of glucose in the blood is between 100 mg/DL and 125 mg/DL, this indicates that the patient has a condition known as prediabetes. My dear friend, I advise you for FBS, PPBS and Urine test if you are suspecting diabetes. She should start daily brisk walking for 30 minutes and decrease fatty foods. Thanx for query."

The blood glucose levels fasting 77 mg is normal. However, 171 mg after lunch if that is after 2 hours, then does signify presence of gestational diabetes. My suggestion is got an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test done immediately. If the test values are above 180 mg after 1 hour, & >153 mg after 2 hours, then it is confirmed as gestational diabetes. This has to be immediately controlled first with dietary control. If that does not work, then Insulin injections. It is absolutely essential to maintain blood glucose between 90 and 120 mg all throughout the day. For expected normal outcome of pregnancy and for the health of the fetus this is necessary. Increased glucose level can lead to a bigger fetus (macroscopic) and difficulty in delivery. So please get the necessary test immediately. Then follow doctors instructions meticulously. Thanks."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, I am a 43 year old African-American female with a history of high blood pressure, and pre-diabetes. I have been experiencing VERY frequent intense heart palpitations, that can be felt in my chest, a fluttering in my throat and a sense of heaviness, lethargy, lightheadedness and mild shortness of breath at times, VERY frequent and irritating burping and belching. I feel as though I m having hundreds of palpitations/flutters per day, onset 5 days ago, usually noticeable while laying down and sitting upright. I have been taking Bisoprolol 10/6.5 for approximately 2 years and the palpitations that I was having at the time I was prescribed stopped for the past year and have now resurfaced. I also had a history of reflux/GERD and I tend to have some relief of the palpitations with a huge belch. I am not so much concerned about the GERD symptoms as much as I am with the fluttering and palpitations, which seem much more intense than before. Could the palpitations be associated with GERD?","Hello, Brief answer: No direct relation between both conditions. Palpitations need to be checked. Explanation: My opinion is that your palpitations are a cause of concern here as it causes low blood pressure in your case (lightheadedness, lethargy) and so you need urgent visit to your cardiologist. Eructation is a maneuver that may terminate some palpitation by vagus nerve stimulation. I suggest my patients the following EKG, chest x-ray and an echocardiogram as a start, I may sometimes order a Holder monitoring which is basically a 24 to 48 hours record of heart rate rhythm. Conclusion: I suggest you check your cardiology specialist as soon as possible. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

The beginning of 2009 I feel ill, severe stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fainting. I was hospitalized 3 times for these symptoms and came up with no answers (except a very unstable blood pressure, low electrolytes and somewhat abnormal heart rate) I was checked for these afterwards and they came up normal. I was sent to my doctor who blamed my symptoms on Anxiety, sent me to a mental health office and presribed me Nexium to help with the symptoms, which it did, but only with the indigestion, the rest of the symptoms stayed and has made it difficult for me to even get a job and complete schooling but I dealt with it as best I could, thinking it was only Anxiety, and at the time was seeking help for. I was born with a hurt murmur and i ve always had Palpitations but recently i ve been getting new symptoms which have been bothersome and I have not tried to contact my doctor for fear of being shunned because of my age and given the same diagnosis. I ve always had a healthy lifestyle of good eating and exercising. I ve found that my normal strong heart palpitation has been more frequent and has actually grown weaker. During activity just from standing and walking it will Palpitate heavily, i ll have trouble breathing, dizzniess, lightheadedness, my ears will ring and I ll have a strong urge to lay down. My heart will beat fast and then slow at random then Palpitate, at unpredictable times such as laying down watching a movie, playing computer games etc but when laying down it is more a struggle to breathe, followed by chest and back discomfort and often with pressure at the same time my heart will be Palpitating. I ll have days where this happens and I can t seem to be able to concentrate on anything and my boyfriend noticed that my circulation has been bad such as freezing and blue fingers and toes as well as the area around my mouth turns blue. I find it hard to talk as well for I can t seem to get enough air even saying simple things. I was never really a smoker but I had smoked for about a month (a pack which I didn t finish) before these symptoms became more noticeable, I had a blood test and it was revealed that I was quite Anemic, I am on an iron supplement and my periods have always been very light. I would go on ignoring these symptoms but they ve been persistent and i m getting impatient. Can you tell me if i m just being silly or should I be worried? P.S. I m not sure if this is related, but i m constantly having to pee in the middle of the night which is more bothersome than anything. I have been checked for diabetes and it came up normal. I do not drink alot of beverages during late night, I only drink water during the day and that s it, though if I drink more in a day the more likely I am get up more often in the night. Thank you for your time, Olivia. ( YYYY@YYYY )","Hi, Olivia; thanks for the query & it's indeed sad to know that you are suffering from so many symptoms without any diagnosis or relief from medications. Based on your age (18 years only) & so many investigations till date which were normal (apart from reduced hemoglobin); you are suffering from a disorder known as Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) which is characterized by pervasive ever encompassing anxiety/worries about day to day trivial things accompanied by multiple non-specific physical symptoms like palpitations, racing heart, choking sensations, Chat Doctor.  Fortunately treatment of GAD is fairly simple. You need to take 6-9 months course of medications like Fluoxetine, paroxetine, Escitalopram, venlafaxine, venlafaxine based on your clinical profile & tolerability. Plus substitute these medications with adjunctive medications like Mizoram, clonazepam, diazepam, pregabalin etc. Also, there is a very good but slightly underused medication by name Buspirone which takes a little longer (6-8 weeks) to show its beneficial effects but gives reliable potent relief! Besides, supplement these medications with mindfulness based relaxation & counselling techniques offered by Psychiatrist & Psychologist. Just get a thyroid profile done to rule out hyperthyroidism which can mimic these symptoms. Contact your Psychiatrist or get back to me for further help. Good Luck"

I read your concerns. Thank you for your query. Now, I spotted two possible cause for these symptoms, from the brief information you provided. First, as it is known sometimes happening to patients suffering from diabetes, who are on glucose-lowering agents (glibenclamid, insulin), the sugar can be lowered below normal range and this is a response to low glucose levels provided to the brain. If this is the case, patient feels weak, is covered in sweat, feels a tremor on his knees. This situation can be overcome with eating a candy bar or Chat Doctor. Second, it can happen by various pacemaker dysfunctions (end-of-life battery, lead dislodgement), i.e. every problem with the pacemaker, which makes it not work properly when needed.

In Jabalpur I also shown to Skin Specialist ,he gave treatment but after some relief it again reappear and the problem is as it. So ,i request to sir kindly guide us for the treatment of the same.","Dear Mr MHRA, If your skin comes up in hives or circular red itchy lesions (with central clearing) that disappears on its own or after medications (usually antihistamines) in a few hours, you are most likely suffering from a condition called urticaria. This can also manifest with swelling under the skin or swelling on lips and tongue called angioedema. This is due to histamine release that may be spontaneous or a secondary trigger like scratching (physical), cold or heat (temperature change) or related to hormonal imbalance. Conditions such as diabetes, underactive thyroid, or other autoimmune diseases make it worse when they are uncontrolled and a proportion of patients with urticaria have autoimmune urticaria while in others it may be idiopathic. High-dose long-acting antihistamines for 3 months (minimum duration) may provide extended relief when stopped but may need to be continued for longer. Fexofenadine 180 mg and cetirizine 10 mg twice daily is the usual choice. Thanks."

He is suffering from something called diabetic foot. It is most commonly due to trivial trauma which forms a non-healing ulcer in diabetics. Infections in patients with diabetes are difficult to treat because they have impaired microvascular circulation and most common bacteria causing infection include streptococci and staphylococci.

Nurses are totally amazed. Doctor is wanting to talk to her and family member about going on warfarin. She`s a fighter and one in a million. Do you think she`ll get past this or will she always have trouble now ?","Hello, Brief answer: It depends on according to her risk factors and cardiac condition. Explanation: My opinion is that cases with multiple risk factors, diabetes, hypertension and ischemic heart disease are a challenge to manage. For your relative, It also depends on whether her heart is in a good condition and function or not. Warfarin is crucial in highly clotting patients or with multiple risk factors. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about vital signs of the patient, the type of neurological defect he or she got and finally other risk factors. Conclusion: I suggest you follow the physician instructions and I hope she is getting better by now. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have started feeling one strong heart beat and then it beats normal for a while. I have been nauseated and have had the hiccups a lot lately too. Just trying to find out if something is serious could be happening. I have diabetes - not under control very well and high blood pressure--I just started taking my medication for this after not taking it for a while because I didnt have my prescription filled.,"Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Hiccups is a normal physiological reflex, related to the diaphragm movements. An elevation of the diaphragm or abdominal distension could cause this clinical scenario. From the other hand the heart lies over the diaphragm. That is why diaphragm elevations can cause palpitations. I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and performing some tests: - a resting ECG- an abdominal ultrasound-some blood lab tests (complete blood count, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests). There are several treatments for hiccups (baclofen, chlorpromazine, metoclopramide). It usually resolves spontaneously. You should discuss with your doctor on these options. Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards, "
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My mother was taken ill with a blood clot in her right arm, while the doctors were doing different tests ready for surgery they found she had a enlarged heart and they also discovered she was type 2 diabetic. My mum was very over weight too. I m 38 now I ve got type 2 diabetic, I m over weight and my doctor has t have a fast heart rate. Could this be an enlarged heart? My mum sadly didn t wake up from the operation. Hope u can help me.","Hello thanks for posting here. Going by your history, since you are a diabetic and overweight, the body tries to compensate and hence the heart rate increases. Regular exercise can help you bring this heart rate down. It will also help in getting control over diabetes (not totally, you should be on medications also) and also help in decreasing your weight. If it is very high (higher than 120) at rest, you can start taking tab coral an 5 mg twice a day which will help you bring the heart rate under control. Also since you have risk factors for heart disease (diabetes, overweight) please get a treadmill test done to rule out early heart disease. But above all regular exercise and diet control is of much help and is a must. Wishing you good health. Regards."

Thanks for the query. There are many possible causes and additional tests are required to define the illness. It may be caused by viral hepatitis, cirrhosis or biliary stone and first step should be ultrasound and viral markers check.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","i am 61 yrs. old female with recurrence of breast cancer i take xeloda 3,000 mg daily per doctor priscription but i experience bloatedness pain in my stomack so i stop taking it and i was relieve. I had my CBC and it shows that my SGOT is 36.80 while my SGPT is normal however FBS shows 8.89 what food do i eat to lower SGOT.. Does this mean my lever is already affected? please answere thank you","Hello Madam, Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns. 1. Normal levels of Serum Lunatic Oxaloacetate Transaminase (GOT) may slightly vary depending on the individual laboratories reference values. In the laboratory I work a value of 36.80 is considered normal, since the range which we consider normal is from 5 to 40 units per liter of serum.2. Even though your liver transaminase (STOP and SGPT)are normal in my opinion, I would recommend you a nutrient-rich, plant-based diet, foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, in addition to being low in fat. Green leafy vegetables, broccoli, carrots, squash and a variety of fresh fruits should be staples of your diet, along with nuts, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and lean meats.3. Fast Blood Sugar value is high. Normally, a value more than 7.0 MML/l or higher on two separate tests indicates that you have diabetes. I would recommend you seek a consult with your local endocrinologist. 4. As I understand, the thing you are most concerned of, is if your test results show that your liver is affected from cancer. My impression is that your laboratory results show nothing to worry, and I don't think that your liver is affected. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health,"

Also I am paler than average Asian.  Also I when I was pregnant I had diabetes even though I had a healthy diet prior to pregnancy and required insulin twice a day.","Hi. Thanks for your query. Read and understood your history of pain in abdomen cramps all over the body, depression, twitching, anxiety, changing hear rates, alternating constipation and diarrhea, altered color of the stools is all indicate that you may be suffering from Cancer of the Gastrointestinal tract may be with involvement of liver and bile ducts too. Diabetes on the insulin would have enhanced the problems and given secondary infections. I would advise :CT scan of the abdomen. All investigations of the blood including sugars, urea, creatinine, liver function tests, electrolytes. Tests of urine and stool.

Please answer as soon as possible please help me","Hi there, There could be many reasons for miscarriage. High prolactin levels which is the hormone secreted by pituitary could cause menstrual problems rather than miscarriage per se. Thyroid imbalance, nutrition problems, diabetes, inherited problems or genetic defects in baby could be the cause of miscarriage. Your wife needs to be evaluated for these. Even though she has had 2 miscarriages her chances of having a full term normal pregnancy in next pregnancy are quite high. Do not worry. Hope this helps. Regards."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Over the past several months my 69 year old father has had difficulty and slurred speech, confusion, loss of sense of direction, etc. does this sound like symptoms of pin strokes? It has developed over the last month of so with more decline noted recently. Perhaps multiple pin strokes?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to know the exact details of onset of his symptoms and any history of medical conditions. Above symptoms can be due to mildly reduced blood supply to the white matter areas in the brain including the areas concerning speech. These can also be due to a series of small stroke like episodes. Another reason for cognitive and speech impairment can also be conditions like hypertension and diabetes. These can also cause microhemorrhages in brain leading to confusion and slurred speech. It will be best to consult a neurologist and get investigations like carotid artery and vertebral artery Doppler and brain MRI scan. Treatment will depend on clinical and imaging findings."

Long-standing diabetes and blood pressure can cause kidney damage. Another common cause of kidney damage is long term intake of painkillers. If these conditions are not there then you need a US of the kidneys to further delineate the cause of your kidney dysfunction. The other values in the urine report do not bother me as much as your creatinine report of 2.1. EFR is basically a value derived from age, creatinine, gender and race.

I pain gradually cept up my lower and upper arms and my muscles became weak. I feel little pain around my neck but the nerve pain had trasferred to the left side, my waist and down to my leg AND FOOT. cAN YOU PLEASE HELP AS i HAVE DIFFICULTY SLEEPING AND FEEL WEAK WHEN I EXERT MYSELF. There are one or two other possibilities for my possible nereve damage : Excessive inhalation of whitewash paint Inhalation of traces of argon gas over a couple of weeks Intestinal problems or diabetes Dejean Johnson","Dear Johnson, Abnormal position during sleep can cause compression of neurovascular structures resulting in tingling, discomfort and pain. The symptoms can last for few minutes to days depending on the amount of nerve damage. These phenomena can explain the symptoms you had in the upper limbs, while I am unable to explain the lower limb weakness too. If a definite weakness is documented by your doctor, then you would need to get a CT / MRI scan of the brain and rule out intracranial pathology such as ischemia / declination.  A specific treatment can be planned based on the results of scan. If no significant / clinically co-relating pathology is found, then we may attribute these symptoms to anxiety and stress.  Hence, a scan is mandatory. Discuss with your treating doctor.  Hope this information suffices. Regards"

I have diabetes that has been controlled for 1 year now. I have a ultrasound every year and the results have been pretty much the same until now . My Dr. has asked me to come in and discuss the findings this time. It looks like it has progressed. I have a copy that was sent to me and I have a question about what this statement might mean . The liver measured 17.7 cm in length (previously 15.8cm) with a coarsely heterogenesous echotexture. The liver edge is again noted to be lobulated in appearance consistent with cirrhosis. the spleen measured 11.1 cm in length (previously 12.3cm ). I am have terrible back pain below my rib cage. Can this really be liver pain that is radiating to my back ?","Hiwith these finding in the ultrasound abdomen added in the back pain, it is better to go for a CT abdomen & pelvis. Followed by MRI spine (TOTAL OR HORACE LUMBAR)so that any serious issues should not be missed. Coarse heterogeneous liver with cirrhosis- it is better to rule out any malignancy relative stages or any secondaries which could have spread to the spine or receivers.

NOT a heart condition. - yet the problem has not gone away - Age 49 - weight 220.  Family history has diabetes, hypertension and heart dieease.  I do not drink or smoke and I amnot taking any meds.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having post inhalation bronchitis. As you are saying that you feel chest tightness after inhaling polluted air, possibility of bronchitis is more. Polluted air when inhaled can cause irritation and inflammation in airways (bronchitis). This will cause bronchospasm and this intern causes chest pressure and tightness.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",in 2003 i had spinal fusion surgery C5/C6. i have had significant size and strength loss to my left arm and leg (varied by as much as a full inch). today i suffered a partial paralysis of both arms after lifting boxes in the garage and also a numbness to the entire upper jaw. the entire event lasted less than thirty minutes but has me freaked out. i am 44 years old and do not want to be paralyzed. can you offer any suggestions?,"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely possibility in your case could be a transient ischemic attack-TIA. In this condition, the blood supply to a part of brain is reduced for a short period of time. This is more likely to occur in presence of risk factors such as diabetes, high BP, cholesterol, smoking, etc. You may get screened for these risk factors.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, Dr. Rynne, I ve been a type 2 diabetic since February 1999 and I m being treated for hypertension. Both conditions are presently well-controlled. On September 9 of this year, blood test revealed eGFR of 57, creatine 1.36, calcium 10.8. My physician told me I was mildly anemic (I told her that I had eaten any meat for 9 months) and she said she d test again in 3 months (end of November). She also said she suspected I was dehydrated and she directed me to resume eating meat and to report for biweekly B-12 shots. Blood test results taken during work-related physical on October 3 indicated eGFR of 54, creatine 1.36 (again) and calcium 10.8 (again). Showed second set of results to my physician who told me not to be too concerned and to await follow-up blood test scheduled for end of November. She doesn t believe I have CKD at this point and feels that the totality of my bloodwork doesn t justify this diagnosis. She stated that eGFR values can move up and down given many factors at time of testing. I have read that once eGFR diminishes, it cannot recover...Doctor, is it possible that I don t yet have kidney disease? And is it possible for eGFR to improve?","Hi, I appreciate your concerns. The risk factors for CKD in your case are diabetes and blood pressure of long duration. If the GFR remains below 60 for a duration of 3 months we label it as CKD stage 2. If you have significant amount of protein in the urine most likely you have kidney dysfunction secondary to diabetes. But there is nothing to worry as we have diagnosed it early and if taken precautions the EFR can be maintained for a long time. The key to prevent further progression at this point is a good control of blood sugar and blood pressure, weight reduction and regular follow up. The anemia is most likely secondary to nutritional deficiency as you are already taking vitamin supplements. I will e pleased to take any queries from you. Tx"

I made an appointment and went to one yesterday and he treated me like I was a drug seeker and refused to even examine me other than to have me squeeze his fingers. I have been diagnosed with Degenerative Disk Disease, Spinlal Stenosis, a herniated disk, diabetes and fibromyalgia. This doctor went on to tell me that I didnt have anything wrong with me. Im not even sure he looked at my medical records that were sent to him by my GP. I have an MRI to back up my disc problems so I dont see how he could have the attitude he had unless he didnt bother looking. Anyway I have to try to find someone else but Im now gun-shy as to how to go about it. The one I went to yesterday was highly reccomended but was a very big dissapointment.  My question is how do I find someone to listen to me and not treat me like a criminal because Im in pain and need medicine to deal with it? By the way Im not a bum.

I was told that if I hadnt had blood work done recently (which I had) that I should have myself checked for diabetes.","Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorYes, your doctor has advised you correctly. Check your blood sugars once, to rule out diabetes. As you have not mentioned your age, Type 2 diabetes most commonly affects people>40 years of age. It is usually diagnosed incidentally. Diabetes is one of the common causes for delayed wound healing. Also take analgesics like ibuprofen and serratiopeptidase containing tablets. That will help you to decrease then pain and swelling. Hope you are happy with the answer. Thank you"

Udizia contains USO delay colic acid. This medication is prescribed by doctors for many conditions especially homeostasis. In your case, it has been prescribed for fatty liver. You have not mentioned whether you consume alcohol. Based on your liver function test report, I presume you do not consume alcohol. Your fatty liver is probably due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Your cholesterol level is normal. Other factors should be looked into which includes obesity, diabetes. If you are obese, you need to reduce weight. If you are a diabetic, then you need to take medications to keep blood glucose under control. This will help to resolve fatty liver.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, today I witnessed my elderly father(80 years old) suddenly find it difficult to walk. He could not seem to move his legs . My mother had to help him sit in his wheelchair and put him to bed. His hands were twitching constantly and he was unable to hold anything. He has been unable to chew or swallow his food however he did drink when a cup was held to his lips. My father has experienced bouts of this over the last 3 months,the last one being 9 days ago. My Mother has told me that usually after a few hours my Fathers motor skills and speech become normal. However todays attack was longer than normal. He has suffered with severe ulcers on both his legs over the last 4 years and has been hospitabilised a number of times with bad infections. My Mother has consulted the GP and they have refered my Father to a neurologist however we are still waiting to see the consultant. Can you give us some understanding of what could be wrong with my Father please","Hi, I am Chat Doctor. I have read your message. I think I can help you. The symptoms of the query are quite suggestive of a stroke. The sudden onset of the symptoms, the motor weakness, the swallowing and speaking difficulty, the shaking of hands. All symptoms are suggestive of the diagnosis of stroke. The fact that he had been having similar episodes over the last 3 months is suggestive of mini strokes that we call TIA medically. These are usually warning signs of an impending stroke. I am unaware from the query about the duration of the symptoms. Within 4 to 8 hours onset should be treated urgently and should be visiting an EMR as soon as possible. He will need urgent treatment. If it is more than that, he needs to meet a neurologist who will probably perform a CAT scan of the brain with or without the angiogram (depending on the protocol of the hospital). As per the report of the CAT scan, medicines may be initiated. I think a low dose statin and antiplatelet should help. I would suggest a scan prior to the initiation of the medicines because the closest differential is a possible cerebral hemorrhage (less likely in view of the mini strokes) where these medicines are not to be given. Meanwhile, I think you should start him on physiotherapy for the motor weakness. Another chance I want to consider here is possible diabetes and hypoglycemia attacks. If the GP has thought about this as a possibility and tested sugars, there is probably nothing to worry about. Otherwise, hypoglycemia in a diabetic patient would explain the brief episodes. And a hypoglycemia can also explain the prolonged symptoms. In such a case, sugars need to be well monitored. The third possibility I need to consider is a vasculitis. This is a common cause of stroke, but usually is thought of in young patients. The last 2 causes I have considered in the view of preexisting foot ulcers which cannot be explained by TIA or current stroke as the ulcers predate the stroke. I think you need to get the scan and meet up with a neurologist. Unfortunately, as explained, I cannot suggest medications without the scan. I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Please feel free to contact me for any further clarification. Best of luck, "

Can you plz explain and suggest any expert dr in india and how fatal it is Thank you","Hi, Your dad is 63 yrs old, and he is a known diabetic. He had abdominal pain and diagnosed as urinary infection, because of pus cells in the urine deposit examination. Even after antibiotics the number of pus cells have increased in number. It is not fatal at all. Your father has got urinal tract infection (UTI). Once the antibiotic given is not active, do a culture and sensitivity, that will reveal what type of organisms are there in the urine and its sensitivity to which antibiotic. If you have the correct antibiotic, mild diuretic and urine Kaiser definitely the infection will be controlled. It is difficult to control UTI for a diabetic, compared with Non-Diabetic. It is always better to take a USG - PUB area to assess the urinary tract. Blood kidney function test should be done. Keeping the Blood Sugar under control is very important. Plenty of water + barley rice water is advised. Best wishes"

Recently, I lost my health care and couldn t get metformin anymore, but then I also started a diet (it s not low carb or calorie deprivation-I eat @ 1300-1400 a day in 3 hr intervals) and have lost 25 lbs so far.

I haven t had any sugar symptoms since starting dieting except the other day, I felt like my sugar was high, so I took half a pill. First time in months.

In any case, you should quit Marijuana smoking as soon as possible. Don't worry, with proper diagnosis and treatment, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

My doctor tested c-peptide and it was .87 and he says my body is not producing much insuline. Last A1C was 13. Should I go see and Endorse or just take lantus like my Md of over 10 years suggest?,"Hello, I understand your hesitancy to go on insulin. It is a natural very normal concern to question a major move such as this. Most certainly if there is any question about a plan of care; seek out a second opinion from a specialist. I do not think your personal physician would take offense at this. I cannot express an opinion on this matter without seeing all of your labs and health history, however, I noted that a c-peptide test was done and that was low indicating to your doctor that you needed the insulin. One thing I would be concerned with is whether you received any type of medical/nutritional advice on controlling blood sugar with diet, exercise and lifestyle. Such interventions can reduce need for medication. Regardless, the blood sugar needs to be controlled to prevent cardiovascular and neurological complications without delay. If you decide on obtaining a second opinion, I would do so without hesitation as time is of importance. If indeed your body is not producing insulin, then you will need insulin injections. If it is a matter of insulin resistance, this may be a different situation where perhaps insulin may be used until other lifestyle modifications are made such as losing weight if overweight, et cetera. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",My son is 32 yrs old and has just found out through blood work that his kidneys are functioning at 45 per cent and he has elevated protein in his blood work. He also says that every time he drinks water he has to go to the bathroom right away. He was checked for diabetes and does not have it. What does this mean,"Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor I have looked through the question and can understand the stress that you must be facing. Based on the question, nephritic or nephrotic kidney disease. There is a chance that there is a chronic renal failure in which the body is not able to excrete the waste substances in the body. This will be most evident with a high level of creatinine in the blood. There are a few modalities of treatment for this. You can start on conservative treatment initially and if your son is stable, then he can control his diet and lifestyle habits so that he can avoid dialysis. Dialysis eventually will start as the kidney function worsens. After some time, itching of the skin and rashes will become prevalent. At this point, I would recommend him to get treated with dialysis. You can also start dialysis early to help him not develop any symptoms. Do talk to a kidney specialist, and you can confirm the Doctors opinions with me. All the best for your son.  Chat Doctor. "

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Hi my husband 43yrs old diabetic has had high blood sugars this evening. Just a few minutes ago his left side went tingling including his tongue. He said this tongue has a metallic taste. I took his blood pressure and it was ok & he did take some baby aspirin. Blood sugars are coming down now and the tingling feeling is diminished to both feet and shin area.,"Hello madam, I understand your concern about your husband. A diabetic patient can have tingling sensation in his body as a result of nerve damage due to high blood sugars, but the pattern of these sensations is usually chronic, symmetrical in both feet extending up to legs(sometimes up to thighs and trunk also) and both hands extending up to forearms(sometimes arms and face also). But this is usually symmetrical and chronic. In your husbands' case it appears to be a sudden episodic, sharply demarcated to one side of the body including face and tongue(which is unusual). Being of sudden onset and restricted to one side of the body followed by recovery, these sensory symptoms mandates a neurological consultation to rule out a vascular event like a transient ischemic attack or even stroke(although, sharp demarcation of sensory abnormality including face and tongue is rare in stroke). Improved and now limited symmetrically to both feet and shin area, is something I mentioned above and well explainable with diabetes. I hope it will be of help."

For frequent cramps in your muscles there might be a possibility of vitamin B deficiency so I suggest taking test on vitamin B deficiency and also Keep vitamin B rich diet in your food. You can also take vitamin B tablet as a supplement. As a physiotherapist I also suggest doing back strengthening exercises as per the suggestion of your physio and do take physiotherapy treatment which can help you to relax your soft tissues as per your physiotherapist guideline. Along with frequent urination, muscle cramp if you also have pain in abdomen Then I suggest doing ultrasound for your abdomen and based on report do what is necessary by visiting your physician.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am a chain smoker for the last 35 years with thin physique. For the last few months I feel a pain in my heart occasionally. However this pain gets relieved when I used to have good diet and sometimes with the intake of milk. About a month back, I left smoking for a fortnight but I observed that the said pain occurred as usual. Due to work and domestic stress, I used to have sex almost every day. Please guide me.","Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that heart pains have some characteristics. They usually are retro-sternal pains likes quizzing, tightness or heaviness. They may irradiate to both arms, neck and jaw. Furthermore, they last from 5 to 20 minutes. We suspect heart disease if we are in front of a patient with RISC factors like age over 45, hypertension, diabetes, smoker and with hereditary history of cardiac disease. Chest pains might have different causes like muscular, Celtic, neurotic or gastrointestinal. So, if you explain pain that relives after consumption of milk this makes us thing of a gastric problem. So, if I was the treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo, a street test, a thorax Rx and a gastrohepatologyst consulting.

In and around my actual anus it is very itchy and has been for years. I try cortisone creams live Walgreens etc but the cream itself makes the condition worse. Prescription strength corticosteroid make it go away and I have even gone so far as to spray the area with flonase nasal spray my mother used for her allergies but I noticed that after I did that I got stretch marks on my lower belly which are now going away. The folds between my buttocks cheeks are now left to right brown/red stained or strangely pigmented mirror images of each other. The texture of the skin is otherwise normal with no skin tags or warts . The area directly around my anus is flaky and itchy and I can peel it off like onion skin. I am a male 46. I have gained a lot of weight slowly over the past 8 years ( about 50 pounds) and I am under psychiatric care for panic and anxiety but in reality I can t climb stairs or walk fast because I get light headed -- this is not panic -- I just assume it is because I am too afraid to let an MD touch me unless its to see a psychiatrist -- I am now taking 4mg alprazoloam per day and mg Inderal. Sometimes the symptoms are better but overall I am severely agoraphobic and my life is awful -- I do not feel like a normal person and it s not mental. I work as a writer and I write very well but my mind is very screwed up. I scare easily and things that would normally just annoy someone, make me get very weak where I have to lie down and sleep -- when I can sleep -- if I am out in the sun or I get hot I feel awful and if my shower is too warm I take hours and hours to cool off. I also have wheezing when I get nervous -- like taking a shower. The wheezing is not that bad but I can feel it. I cannot lift or carry anything -- I get so weak so fast that I have to lie down and rest -- sometimes it takes days to get over this. This atrted in 2006 with a full blown panic attack and some kind of subsequent nervous breakdown but prior to that I was fearful of cold sores which wi Oulw get once every two years -- most of this started after the death of my younger brother which was very bad but I find it hard to believe that everyone else in my family is okay, but I am this big fat, sweaty, out of breath, itchy assed, guy who can no longer work or do anything sociable without having a glass of wine -- if I try to take less xanax I get horrible withdrawal symptoms -- all it does not is keep me from getting withdrawal -- there is really no ther purpose for taking it.. Also, this all started at the same time I developed a lot of discreet keratosis on the backs of my hands and the tops of my feet.","Hi. I realize the feeling you have with all those conditions. Itching and flaking around the anus and in the buttock area, which tend to be moist is likely due to fungal infection. Fungal infections are notorious to get better with steroids, but recur in the same areas causing a vicious cycle with their use. Blood stains occur due to repeated excoriation and itching and the area becomes macerated when moist. So please get a fungal smear of the area, to see for fungal elements which can be then taken care of by keeping the area Chat Doctor.  Also check your blood glucose profile checked because this may be the harbinger of diabetes, which you are prone to being obese. Steroids would cause skin atrophy and stretch marks on repeated use and needs to be stopped, as also can it cause systemic side effects with repeated use. Hope I have answered your query. Thank you."

What you are describing can be shortly described as severe numbness all over your body including oral cavity. If it was a localized area, I would have suggested you to consult a neurologist to rule out nerve related problems.

I studied your query in details given by you.-Regarding Cause of Groin Lump--As the lump is growing over 2-3 myths, mostly it appears to be an inguinal hernia.-For typing it-I would advise you to consult an ER Surgeon for a clinical check -which is very essential for you to decide the type of the hernia? Indirect or Direct / or if its femoral ?like that.-In your case being a heavyweight lifter -your hernia is Indirect inguinal type.-It's definitely a hernia -as it pains when you stand after sitting / and hence definitely the groin lump is not lymph node.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","What are some other possible factors that cause left ventricular thickening other than hypertension?  I am in good health (other than some ankle ortho problems) and was recently told this by my cardiologists nurse.  Trying to do some homework before I meet with my cardiologist again in a few weeks.  I do have high high BP family history, but mine is excellent.  Also have family history of diabetes.","HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor. I can certainly understand your concerns and have worked through your query in detail. Left ventricular hypertrophy is primarily due to elevated blood pressure over a long period of time. This will mainly cause increased external workload on the heart against which it has to pump blood to meet the body demands. This over a period of time will cause the heart muscle to increase in muscle thickness leading to ventricular hypertrophy. This can serve as a risk factor for heart disease particularly ischemic heart disease like Myocardial infarction. Hence, it is important to keep the blood pressure under control to prevent such events. I advise you to take anti hypertension medication that can reverse this ventricular hypertrophy and eliminate the risk for heart disease. Chat Doctor. A periodic echo and ECG of the heart will also be helpful in monitoring the reversibility of ventricular hypertrophy. Diet low in sodium content is equally important. Please check with your Cardiologist if he shares my view and if you can prescribe these pills and investigations to you. Post your further queries if any. Thank you."

Thanks!,"Repeated raised rash on the skin after a certain kind of food suggests that there is some kind of allergen that can't be resisted by individuals immune system. It could be urticaria too. Still want to give the same food? Chances are rashes may double next time or even more next to that. Wisdom is to avoid it. But before quitting that food you should ensure that same food is culprit. Anti allergic in modern toxic medicine relieves fast but doesn't cure nor does it create immunity. Alternatively Ayurveda has the answer. If you can give pure turmeric powder + Need leaves + Sugar candy powder (if not diabetic) in 1:1:1 ratio and give the mixture 1/4 tsp every eight hrs. Mixed in honey (again if not diabetic) for a week to two weeks, you will start seeing lesser or no rashes appearing. But the effect comes slowly being natural things.

Ever since she has been about 4yrs old she has suffered from lethargy and lately have noticed slight tremor in hands when she starts to get hungry before regular meals. After eating she is fine again for about 4hrs.","Hello, Read your concernThere are many causes for which your granddaughter may have these symptoms. Please get her blood sugar level checked to rule out diabetes which may cause such symptoms. Also, such symptoms may be seen in a condition known as insulin which is a tumor of the beta cells of the pancreas. This tumor is characterized by Whipple s triad where signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are seen with blood glucose levels lower than 45 mg/DL. The characteristic feature is improvement of the symptoms on administration of glucose. This leads me to advice you to get the blood glucose, insulin and c-peptide levels tested. These will help us to rule out other conditions of hypoglycemia as well. A proinsulin level is also advice, if possible. Diagnostic imaging test would include USG, CT scan or an MRI to trace the tumor, if any. It will be appreciated if you could provide more details about her symptoms at the time of tremor. As for e.g.: does she get cold and clammy, irritated, anxious, does she sweat a lot etc. These will be of help too. Hope you get back with the Blood reports. Take care. Hope this helps. Chat Doctor.

I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the symptoms you describe may be related to several problems. The main cause may be a stroke, causing loss of sensibility in half of the body, causing unsteady gait and inability to control the hand properly. Another problem would be a polyneuropathy, typical in diabetes, but it is associated with pain and tinglings in both feet and hands. Diabetic patients can also have seizures from high blood glucose, causing numbness in half of the body, but these are episodic, non-permanent. So to conclude I would recommend a good neurological examination, a full blood work, HbA1c and a brain CT scan. If these tests result normal, an Electroneurography for polineuropathy and a EEG would be necessary. Hope to have been helpful! Thank you for using Chat Doctor! Greetings, "

He also dnt want baby right now, I am really depressed, plz guide me","Hello, Normally couples married for one year have intercourse 2-3 times a week. But having less frequency does not point out towards any specific disorder especially when it is not associated with any problem with sexual performance (Erectile Dysfunction/ Premature Ejaculation) or other depressive/anxiety features (decreased interest in pleasurable activities/sadness of mood, hopelessness, death wishes).It's a possibility that he may be stressed out and not yet ready for kids therefore not going for intercourse. You need to talk to him and be open about your desires of sexual gratification so as you two can sort this out to resume your healthy sexual life. You may have to let him see the woman in you so as he should be attracted to you sexually more frequently. The reason for his lack of sexual desire if persists despite that may be depression, low testosterone (male sex hormone) levels, or other medical conditions such as diabetes or thyroid problem which decreases the libido. Since the reason for your depression is lack of sexual gratification by your husband, that is the treatment for you. If your depression persists, see a psychiatrist and get couple counseling. Hope the answer is helpful. Take care and feel free to ask queries. Regards."

My blood urea remains high around 60 mg/dl, creatinine is within normal limits. LFT shows SGPT high 117 units , Ggt is also little raised and there is slight increase in phosphorus level also. I do regular walk and exercise everyday and lead an active life.What is the reason for high levels given above","Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Are you an alcoholic ? Do you have yellow discoloration of eyes and urine/ decreased urine output/ decreased appetite/recurrent nausea or vomiting? Gamma GT is very specific to liver and higher values indicates liver pathology. SGPT is also specific to liver, but it has multiple origins. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist and should go for thorough check up. You should also go for ultrasound imaging for liver and kidney status. Rise in urea could be due to liver pathology. You should also go for Australia antigen and HCV. You should avoid banana, juices and coconut. Take care,"

Positive TMT is suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD) Stress and anxiety are independent risk factors for heart diseases like CAD. And risk of CAD is high in post menopausal woman (54 years).

Could it be MRSA? my circulation is poor and some loss of feeling in the toes is present. what is going on?,"Hello. Feet are generally the most undeclared for part of the body. It is in constant contact with the ground from which it can pick up millions of bacteria, one of them being MRSA. Note that I said ONE in a million could be MRSA.  You have a sore in the toe mostly due to repeated trauma or single bruise on the foot and have ignored the injury, or you have a foot ulcer secondary to diabetes. There are multiple causes for an ulcer/sore.  But since you complain only of pain and no swelling or pus I do not think it has reached the stage of infection. MRSA is not your worry now. Kindly give a cold pack and observe for two days. If the pain does not subside it is better to consult a surgeon, and he will have a better idea if it is a concealed infection. Even if it turns out MRSA do not panic as we have sufficiently large antibiotic ranges to treat these resistant bacteria. "

I have a daughter who will be 4 on April 4th. For the last week she has been asking for food nonstop saying she is hungry all day. She is small for her age. 29lbs, and yet her stomache looks bloated and sticks out. She also has urinated in her pants once for the last 3 days. She has been potty trained since 2 and this has never been an issure.She still wares a pull up at night, and wakes up with it soaked in the morning. She also complains of a sore tummy 3 or more times a week, for the last few month, she does drink a lot and wakes up 1-2 times a night scraming that she is thristy. She has also been having fits, and mood swings. She does have a new baby sister who is 5 months old. I m not sure if she is just acting out because of the baby, or if these might be signs of diabetes. Diabetes does run on both sides of our family. I m thinking that I should take her in and get her tested. Do you agree that this would be the right thing?","Hello! Thank you for writing! I understand your concern! I congratulate you on your medical knowledge, and your good explanation of the situation. As you said : polifagia that is the feeling of hunger, polyuria that is the need to urinate frequently, polydipsia that is the felling of thirst, and low body weight although eating a lot, are signs of diabetes. As also it runs in your family it is important to rule it out and to do a blood glucose test after fasting. So your child eats at 8:00 clock pm and in the 8:00 am of the other day with empty stomach you do a blood glucose test to check. In base of the results you should visit and endocrinologist pediatrician. It is important to rule this out. Maybe she wants attention too but better rule out the cause of diabetes. Thank you. Wish your daughter good health."

Unable to find in local directory nor remember name.","Hello. Welcome to Chat Doctor. The treatment of ulcers is generally by regular cleaning and Chat Doctor.  Antibiotics may be given if the ulcer is infected. However, treatment of the cause is more important. The most common causes which I have seen in my practice are1. Improper and ill-fitting footwear - Try to wear more comfortable ones.2. Varicose veins - cause ulcers mostly near the inner side of foot. 3. Diabetes - diabetes by itself does not cause ulcers but increases the chances of developing them by decreasing the sensations over the skin. These ulcers take a long time to heal, hence early treatment is important. Apart from these common causes there are other causes affecting the arteries and veins which may cause ulcers. Diagnosis is helped by clinical examination, history and by tests like Doppler of the legs. Since you have not mentioned the other conditions you have or the duration of the ulcers, I have given a generalized overview for you. However, I am afraid I cannot help you with the medical supply stores in your area. Wishing you good health."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",My daughter is suffering from eating disorder (restricting calories). she is presently in a behavorial facility. Her Alt And AST keep fluating. They have been abnormal since the end of April. I am concerned these levels are not going back to normal. We have been told that it is normal for them to flucuate but we are concerned. She is asymptomatic. My question is why do they fluate and how long does it take for them to normalize. Another bit of information is she had completely normal labs in Feburary .,"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Firstly, I must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation. The entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation. You have provided only the AST and ALT values. Therefore, I can only answer in general terms. Serum aminotransferases: are of two types.- alpine aminotransferase (ALT) and- aspartame aminotransferase (AST). Elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. The AST is less live specific than the ALT. Elevations of the AST level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). Mild degrees of ALT level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise. Disproportionate elevations of the AST and ALT levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). The AST/ALT ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the AST level is 400 IU/mL or lower. Common causes of mild increases in AST and ALT levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse. The ratio of AST to ALT may give additional clues as to the cause:- In chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis ALT > AST,- In chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis AST > ALT. Extremes of the ratio of AST:ALT may also be sometimes useful:- ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and-Do not worry. It will take around 6 months for the enzymes to be normal again. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.

The symptoms like epigastric flutters, anxiety, fear etc. could be occurring due to anxiety. You are on antacids for epigastric discomfort still the symptoms are persisting.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi,I m 34weeks pregnant now and have gestational diabetes. When I checked my sugar levels before a week it was 103 during fasting and 181 after breakfast, 140 after lunch. Done with my scan the baby weight is 2kg. Taking insulin of 5units in morning, 3units in afternoon and 8units in night. What are the complications wil I face during delivery and will this diabetes continue after my delivery?","Hello, uncontrolled gestational diabetes may cause babies to enlarge (particularly their shoulders). This enlargement may cause trouble during delivery and increase the risk for injuries to the baby and to the mother. There are several other potential complications, but this is by far the more common. Your babies weight is not that high, so it seems that diabetes has not affected it, although ultrasound scan evidence would be needed to say that for sure. Your blood glucose measurements are high - all three of them. The target levels are:- below 93 for fasting glucose-below 130 (and preferably below 120) for postprandial (1st hour) glucose haven't mentioned what insulin you're using. I suppose it has to be NPH. Correcting the fasting blood glucose would usually require increasing night insulin (and perhaps adding a snack before bedtime to avoid hypoglycemia and/or ketosis). Since the morning hormones are hindering blood glucose control, you should be more careful in what you eat for breakfast. Avoiding high glycemic index carboy Chat Doctor.  Gestational diabetes goes away after delivery - almost always! Checking your blood sugar the very next morning will convince you about that! Gestational diabetes increases your risk for type 2 diabetes in the near future so you've got to do an oral glucose tolerance test a couple of months after delivery and every three years ever after. I hope I've helped! If you'd like more information, please contact me again. Kind Regards and good luck with your pregnancy!"

Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. Usually liver enlargement may indicate some types of hepatitis or fatty liver diseases and in most cases it doesn't require any specific treatment.  If this is caused by diet, obesity and diabetes then dietary and lifestyle changes will be beneficial in every case. Alcohol and viral hepatitis are the most common causes and in this case medical evaluation is required. Also, if there is infectious disease or biliary duct disorders then you need to do some tests to rule out more serious issues which require specific medical treatment. You need to check your viral markers and do liver biopsy if necessary. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards.

Back pain is a common occurrence in healthy women during pregnancy, even those without any background disc disease. Because of this, there is definitely a possibility that pain or other symptoms from your slipped disc might get worse as you gain weight and as your pregnancy grows. However, there is no additional risk to the baby or pregnancy from having disk disease. Your history of gestational diabetes is actually the most concerning potential complication for this pregnancy. You should be tested early in the pregnancy to see if you are diabetic, and if you start the proper diet and or medication treatment as soon as possible, it will give you the best likelihood of a good pregnancy outcome. So in summary, the pregnancy itself is not at any additional risk because of your disc disease. However, your back pain could get severe, especially if you gain a lot of weight, and is unpredictable how this will affect your ability to do household activities and care for your other child Chat Doctor.

I am 4ft10 and weight 7stone5 so not anyway over weight but my mum says Im going to get disabilities from having all that sugar in my tea. Is this correct? Do I need to cut down?","Hello and welcome to ask a doctor service. I reviewed your query and here is my answer. It looks like you are adding a lot of sugar to your single cup of tea. If you are slim and not overweight and no history of family diabetes, then it may pose a little problem like having a risk of diabetes in the future. So you need to lower intake of sugar in your diet and start eating other things more instead of sugar or take sugar less in amount. Else I have seen many patients who do take sugar even more than you with no problems, but one should be careful and cautious about health. So decreasing intake is in your own good.

I have put on lotion with vitamin e for 3 days twice a day and 90 % is gone...but it will come back if I do not put lotion on for awhile...it looks horrible ..what is causing this?","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of Pseudoacanthosis Nigerians as the reason for the dark patches around the neckPseudoacanthosis Nigerians is a skin disorder in which there is darker, thick, velvety skin in body folds and creases. The skin becomes dark, velvety and thick in areas such as back and sides of neck, armpits, thighs, elbows and knees. Acanthosis Nigerians usually appears slowly and doesn't cause any symptoms other than skin changes. It typically occurs in individuals younger than age 40, may be genetically inherited, and is associated with obesity OR endocrinopathies, such as hypothyroidism, acromial, polycystic ovary disease, insulin-resistant diabetes, or Bushings disease. The majority of cases of acanthuses Nigerians are associated with obesity OR are otherwise idiopathic. This is likely because of insulin resistance, and more likely to occur in darker-skinned persons. This is also known as Pseudo-Acanthosis Nigerians. Acanthosis Nigerians is likely to improve in circumstances where a known cause is removed. For example, obesity-related acanthuses Nigerians will improve with weight loss. People with acanthuses Nigerians in general should be screened for diabetes. Weight loss and controlling blood glucose levels through exercise and diet often improves symptoms. Topical retinoid 0.05% cream once daily at night helps to lighten pigmentation along with weight loss, exercise and diet management. Alpha-Lipoic acid ha been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and thereby reverses the pseudo-acanthosis Nigerians which arises as a result of insulin resistance states e.g. Obesity and diabetes. It is commercially available for prescription in acanthuses Nigerians. Regards"

How much per day is recommended of each for someone with my condition?,"Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that cholesterol target levels depends on some factors like your age and other associated rich factors like hypertension, diabetes, smoking and hereditary history of high cholesterol levels. Normal cholesterol level should be below 180 mg / DL and for LDL col below130 mg / DL in normal people. If you have tried a dietary modification and didn't have good results than its necessary to start medical treatment.Omega-3 are supplements that helps but the best anti lipid class are statins like atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin etc. For aortic dilatation its necessary to know its dimension and valvular situation. If there is a slight dilatation than you just need to control your blood pressure rigorously and make regular cardiac echo. If the dilatation is sever, then it might need surgery. Hope I was helpful.

He has swelling of the legs from the blockage of his lymph vessels and this can lead to oozing of lymph if there is any scratch or abrasion. This problem is produced by the dead worms in his lymphatic system especially in the lymph nodes. His fever can be due to two reasons. If he has an infection of his leg or if he has microfibril in the blood. A night blood sample examined for micrfilaria may show it if it is present, and then it should be treated with the medicine Diethylcarbamazine (Betrayal). If there is infection of the leg abrasion or ulceration he would require local and systemic antibiotics. The important way to avoid infection is to keep the legs clean and take care that he walks around only with protective footwear and to wash the legs every day with water and mild disinfectant.Also, please check whether he suffers from diabetes which will increase his chance of infection.

He has beeen staying pretty steady at 101 up until now.  He is soaking the bed at night from sweat and having hot and cold flashes.  He has headaches and his chest is sore, his voice is getting scratchy.  He wont go to the doctor.  Is there something that I can help with?  I  have been taking care of him and sleeping next to him and have not had any of his symptoms, should I make him go to the doctor?","Thank you for your query. Would you please clarify a few things for me?1) How long has he had the fever? Does he have the chills (shivering)?2) Any cough with phlegm? How long ?3) any urinary symptoms (burning sensation, pain, urgency and increased frequency?4) does he have any other health issues (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, autoimmune disease)?5) is he on any medication? His symptoms, collectively, point to a respiratory tract infection. Four days of fever with worsening symptoms and obvious changes in normal body behavior warrants a visit to his doctor. A quick exam and some blood work(if required), a throat swab or sputum culture will help the physician diagnose and treat it. Most viral infections are self limiting and recovery begins in about a week from the time of onset of symptoms. If he continues to have a high fever (102F), develops severe headache, lethargy, Chat Doctor. In the meantime, make sure he is well HY"

It s the weekend don t want to emergency also on oxygen. Can I pop it afraid I won t last till Monday. Don t want to be around a lot of sick people. Have water blister that s just healed a other foot thankyou,"A jumbo egg blister, ouch! I don't know your full medical history, but based on the information you gave me, it sounds like your diabetes is advance. Diabetics with advance disease have poor wound healing. I unfortunately have taken care of many diabetic patients who have developed ulcers, skin infections, and even bone infections after popping a massive blister. Again, I don't know how bad your diabetes is, but to be safe, I strongly advice against popping your blister. The response written above is a medical opinion, and does not substitute an evaluation by a medical professional. I cannot guarantee accuracy in my answer, especially when I cannot physically evaluate you, and do not know your past medical history, all the medications you are on, your lifestyle habits, etc.; therefore I cannot be held liable for any consequences that occur as a result of my opinion."

This is 3rd such lump in last 3 months and quite painful, also bleeds sometimes. First two got cured in around a week. Doctor said it is Phycosys Barbarine, though I am unable to find out any such reference on net.","HI, Good Evening. Thanks for your query. I studied the query in-depth. I understand your concerns. In my opinion-you have-Recurring folliculitis. I would advise -FBS, PPs to rule out the diabetes-which may cause its recurrent infection.-If you shave with the barber -Psychosis Barbara psuedofolliculitis is the other cause. This is caused by the irritation of the barbers shaving cream and the ingrown hair.-It differs from the folliculitis-and is also known as the Barbers ITCH. . Consult your skin doctor/family physician. Tb-NSAID, Antibiotic,and anti-diabetic if your sugar is high.-This would relieve your painful lump on the chin.-Wishing you early recovery and good health.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Swollen underneath tongue, chin, severe pain, hurts to open mouth, chew, difficulty swallowing, pain so severe I can feel it in back of my head (headache).  This follows dental surgery 25 days ago to remove  teeth (front bottom), two implants, and two bone grafts.  Also follows 5-6 weeks of flu-like symptoms (respiratory, high fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.), but doctor tested me twice (two weeks apart) for flu type a and b and tests were negative.  Doctor concluded some type of respiratory infection that mimicked the flu that had to run its course.  I was on 3 different rounds of antibiotic before and after the dental surgery, which I finished clindamycin last Thursday, but this sore throat feeling in the glands began Tuesday (two days before finishing third round of antibiotic.  I am diabetic due to severe pancreatitis so diabetes behaves like Type 1.  I am totally insulin dependent.  I take huge doses of levamere (60 units a.m. and 50 units p.m.) and use Humalog sliding scale (high scale used at local hospital).  I take Lyrica 100 mg 4 times daily for severe neuropathy for years now, and synthroid.  Today I saw my doctors nurse practioner who diagnosed my swollen, painful mouth as post dental surgery trauma.  Tomorrow I will see dental surgeon who is unhappy with the speed at which I am healing (hes not the only one!).  I have tried ice, heat, Tylenol, ibuprofen.  Thankfully the nurse practioner gave me a few hydrocodone (7.5) to take today until I see dental surgeon tomorrow.  I am a 56 years old woman and I live in assisted living so my diet and my medication are handled professionally.  I am very afraid that my dental surgeon is not going to be able to diagnose this tomorrow and since last Tuesday the condition only worsens no matter what I try.  Even the hydrocodone is not completely relieving my pain and what little help it does provide only seems to last for about 2 hours.  (After the pancreatitis and complications, I have a high tolerance for pain meds).  My doctor and I rarely choose the narcotic pain relief route unless we absolutely have to (i.e. following the dental surgery, I took 3 days of Percocet 10s.  Since then I have only used Tylenol and Ibuprofen (neither of which are any help right now--they were helping until this swelling began last Tuesday.  I am in tears as I sit here describing all of this.  I realize my case is complicated:  I had to move into assisted living 5 years ago when I started having TIAs and could no longer live alone.   The professional care I receive here has made the TIAs almost non-existent.  When I lived alone, prior to coming here, I did not take care of my diabetes.  Now I do.  What do you think?","Hello, It looks like there is some infection associated with the implant leading to Cellulitis or infection in the salivary gland leading to pain and swelling. So, my suggestion is to consult your dentist or an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated.  You can be advised an x-ray or MRI Scan to further confirm the cause. For now, you can be advised antibiotics intravenously and a steroid shot to reduce swelling. Also, you can be advised Implant removal if the infection or implant rejection is suspected. So, getting checked by an oral surgeon is a must. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

Do you think that this changes in my glucose are something to worry about?","Firstly all the blood pressure reading mentioned are in the normal range and so you need not worry about the same.  You are true in saying that statin does cause new onset diabetes, but the risk is rare. To be frank its 1 in 250 patients treated with statin over 5 years may have diabetes.

We figured a muscle strain but then thought about the fact that this isn t the first time he has said his heart hurts. He does not and has not been sick during these complaints. The morning after his complaint the other day after T-Ball he complained the back of his neck hurt. He slept 8 hours that night but an hour after being up was fatigued and fell asleep in the car. He woke up from napping screaming in pain that his arm hurt. After 5 or 10 minutes he was fine. We have another son with Congenital Heart Disease so we do have a family history of heart disease.

Should I go for a normal delivery or a C- Section ? Which one is good for me and my baby ??","Hi, Neither your age, diabetes, history of missed abortion or high triglycerides make you a candidate for Cesarean. You should definitely try for a normal delivery, and only if some problem arises for the baby or you during labor will the obstetrician be considering a cesarean. Is your diabetes in control, are you taking insulin for the diabetes? If so, when was your last growth scan of baby done, and in what gentile was baby growth. Sometimes with uncontrolled diabetes the baby can put on excess fat around its neck and shoulder area and cause a difficult delivery. These things will be kept in mind by the obstetrician at the time of delivery.Also, if you are on Insulin, it is likely that your Obstetrician will advise Induction of labor at 38 weeks.

Any of these places of reference may be involved without discomfort in the chest. The relationship to exertion is then the indication that the pain is probably of cardiac origin.

Please suggest me a proper solution for this disease .Common symptoms:1) Cold fever2) headache3) vomiting4) Body pain5) coughing6) Tiredness","Hello, Thanks for the query. In a person with diabetes generally the resistance is lowered. So there can be repeat infections. Hence, it is absolutely essential to achieve a very strict blood glucose control. Ideally FBG: should be <100 mg, PP 150 to 160 mg & HbA1c% <6.8.  With good blood glucose control, healthy balanced diet and regular exercise for about 1 hour a day, he should be able to live free from repeat infections.

I am a type 2 diabetic but technically considered a type 1 because I have had chronic pancreatitis for 8 years and my whole pancreas is diseased I produce no insulin & have to take creon to eat. Anyway my question is about what my kidney function results mean. It says U microalbumin conc is 85 & my U microalbumin /G creat is 86 can you tell me what this means about my kidneys?","Hi, From above narration it is clear that you have pancreatic diabetes mellitus.  Though in it there is no insulin production by pancreas (B cell), it is different from Type I DM because of low level of glucagon (anti insulin hormone produced by pancreatic alpha cells) in pancreatic DM that's why low chances of development of diabetic ketoacidosis (acute complication of Type I DM) in pancreatic diabetes. In pancreatic DM pancreas also cannot produce enzymes needed for digestion and hence enzymes are supplied in form of tab Creon. In pancreatic diabetes development of microvascular complications of diabetes (diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) is same as in Type II DM, though development of macro vascular complication (heart attack, CVS (paralytic attack)) are very less in pancreatic DM. For screening of development of diabetic nephropathy there is test called as renal function test which includes serum creatinine, urea, BUN, electrolytes, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, urine examination for microalbumin or SPT urine urinary albumin creatinine excretion ratio. In your case Urinary microalbumin concentration of 85 & Urinary microalbumin to creatinine ratio of 86 denote presence of microalbunuria, which is early predictor of development of diabetic nephropathy and other microvascular complications. You should also screen for diabetic retinopathy by doing endoscopy, foot examination for neuropathy."

Thanks for calling Chat Doctor. Forum.  Your uncle passed away with pancreatic cancer, Diagnosed only two weeks before death. He had jaundice, malaria, typhoid, along with this. He had diabetes and hypertension. After 6 hours of death a dilute blood like substance started flowing from his nose and mouth.  Probably the sequence is different, in the beginning he is diagnosed as typhoid, malaria, and jaundice, this sequence is common.  Finally, it might be a false diagnosis and pancreatic cancer is the final diagnosis, there might be co existing previous diseases, but neither these nor the treatment given for that can't lead to the pancreatic cancer.  Regarding bleeding the hypertension or the jaundice or cancer can predispose to the bleeding, and followed after the demise.  I hope I have answered to your satisfaction."

Around midnight I go to bed and take 2x Benadryl to help me breathe better.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I ve been taking Cipralex for anxiety for almost a year. I am currently taking 20mg/day and have recently noticed an elevation in glucose levels, and am having trouble controlling them. Blood pressure is elevated lately as well. Could this be due to the Cipralex? Is there another anti-anxiety medication that is more blood sugar-friendly?","Hello, Cipralex may indeed cause blood glucose disorders and blood pressure disorders, although both are rare. It may cause both hypo- and hyper- glycemic (the effect cannot be individually predicted) and both hypo- and hypertension. Such side effects occur in less than 1% of patients taking 20 mg of Circle. It has to be even less likely in patients who have been taking it for a year without any side effects. Perhaps your doctor should try to identify other potential causes for your problems. Weight gain and sedentary lifestyle are inciting factors for hyperglycemia, although genetics play a major role in it - some individuals will never develop diabetes no matter how fat they become, others will experience hyperglycemia even when they stay lean. The same factors are important for hypertension as well. Salt consumption is another important factor in this regard. Checking your glucosylated hemoglobin would be recommended. High glucosylated hemoglobin may indicate that treatment for diabetes might be necessary... Regarding your blood pressure. Measuring your blood pressure (at least twice each time) for at least one week will give your doctor a better idea about it. 24-hour blood pressure monitoring (Holder) may be even more accurate in detecting blood pressure issues. So in conclusion, I don't believe that these symptoms are caused by Circle - although I can't 100% exclude it. An investigation is required to determine the extent of these issues and whether treatment is required or not. I wouldn't recommend any change to your regimen without discussing the matter with your doctor first. Consequently, I wouldn't recommend any other antianxiety medication. A rate of less than 1% for side effects is perfect for any Chat Doctor. "

Please help, am paranoid of this pulmonary tuberculosis. Thanks, Lilou","Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Tuberculosis is more common in upper lobes and less common in lower lobes. TB bacilli grow faster and have higher affinity for oxygen. And in lungs, upper lobes have the highest oxygen concentration. So Tuberculosis affects upper lobes more. It can affect lower lobes in diabetes and His infection. So in my opinion get done screening for diabetes and His.  If both are negative then Tuberculosis is less likely in your case. Also get done sputum examination for Aug (acid fast bacilli-TB bacilli). If this is normal then no need to worry about Tuberculosis. You are having mostly bacterial pneumonia. So start treatment accordingly."

I understand your concern, and would like to explain that it is very important to identify whether your husband suffers from diabetes, and if it is so, to check about possible underlying consequences. Regarding this purpose, I would recommend to check first a fasting blood glucose and a post radial one. If no clear evidence are found, a glucose tolerance test should be tried, too. You need to perform a glycosylated hemoglobin test (HbA1C), to make evidence of the last months glucose balance. Whichever be the reason for the actual clinical symptomatology (diabetes or glucose intolerance), your husband needs to check besides the other routine lab tests, also repeatedly blood glucose, his liver and renal function tests, microalbuminuria, as well as an ocular endoscopy, etc. Some diet and lifestyle modulations are necessary for a better blood glucose control, and to treat also the other possible coronary risk factors. You need to discuss with his attending cardiologist about these issues. Hope to have been helpful to you. Greetings! "

So the treatment started is fine. Metformin helps to sensitize tissue to insulin and weight loss does the same. The best management is weight loss by daily exercise and proper diet that helps restore the hormonal mile.Also, you have tried for only 5 months. It is suggested that a couple must try to conceive for at least 8-12 months spontaneously before undergoing any infertility treatment. The main issue in POD is an ovulation meaning ovum is not released to get fertilized. I suggest that you try the weight control and metformin for 2 months and then get an ovulation study [ultrasonographic] done to see if ovulation is occurring. If it is, then you may need to practice sexual contact on those days to achieve pregnancy. If there is no ovulation with this treatment, you may need some ovulation inducing Chat Doctor.

Do I need to modify my diet and what does this mean for my prognosis.","Hello, you haven't mentioned you hematocrit or the rest of the complete blood count results. It's hard to give specific advice without knowing the facts. Also, please note that the A1c result is credible only when the hematocrit is within normal range. Your EFR corresponds to stage 3 chronic kidney disease. At this stage, it's likely that no symptom is evident. 5% of stage 3 patients do have anemia, although it's far more common in stages 4 or 5. Your MCH is not helping either, without the rest of the results. If you do have a high MCH then a microcytic anemia is possible. Since you were using metformin, you should probably check your vitamin B12, which is a common cause of anemia in patients with diabetes. I could be more accurate if I had the results. If you're on a healthy diet then you don't need to do anything about it. If not, then the following general advice would be appropriate. Red meat: once in 7-10 days. Poultry: 3 times/week.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",i am 7 months pregnant and just found out that  i have a blood pressuare ranging from 162/92 and if its low it is 154/70 so i was wondering if this is caused by food or stress level i have and if its food is it healthy for me to eat maggi 2 minutes noodles,"Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern I would explain that these values of blood pressure are really concerning for possible preeclampsia which is a serious situation during pregnancy. It is very important to consult with your attending physician for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a urinalysis (luminaria) and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, plasma total protein). You need to start therapy and treat the possible triggering factors (like urinary infection and diabetes). An ultrasound to examine the fetus is necessary, as this disorder is harmful for the baby and the mother. Hope to have been helpful! Best wishes!"
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","On Sunday October 26 I was in an ATV accident and received a rather deep puncture wound on the front of my left shin. I was taken to the emergency room and received a good cleaning along with 2 stitches, X-rays revealed there were no objects or debris left inside the wound and my leg was not broken but had hyperextended during the crash. I visited an Orthopedic surgeon Wednesday the 29th of October where I was prescribed antibiotics but wasnt given a promise that it would prevent infection. I am in so much agony and pain as of right now, not only has the pain gotten worse but it is traveling up from my shin to my knee cap as well. I am almost 100% certain my puncture has gotten infected, I keep it clean and wrapped with gauze but it stays swollen and hot to the touch. I have become nauseous and lost my appetite these past 2 days and have noticed a bruise on the heel of my left foot which seems to grow increasingly. I did not notice the bruise until yesterday and it was dime size, now it is the size of a half dollar coin and is very purple. I am concerned I may have an infection in my bone as well because of the excruciating pain inside of my shin and knee cap now. I will call my Orthopedic Surgeon on Monday morning to schedule an appointment. What are the chances it may be developing into gangrene? Should I go ahead to the emergency room or can I wait? All other areas of my body that were injured have healed beautifully except for my left shin. Thank you so much for your time!","Hello, It seems that you are uncertain about following.1)Whether there is any infection at puncture site?2)Bruise gone unnoticed3)Whether there is any chance to develop gangrene?4)Have to wait and watch? Answers are here.first u have not mentioned that whether u have been prescribed any painkillers or not. Neither you have mentioned the name of antibiotic. Now,1) If u have developed any infection at your wound site, u probably have developed fever, which u have not mentioned .2)Bruise is called ""delayed bruise"" as it develops after about certain time of actual impact. If it is of purple color, it's in the phase of healing. No treatment required for that except painkillers.3)There is a chance to develop gangrene, when you leave your wound in unhygienic condition, do not take proper antibiotics, already have undiagnosed diabetes. Otherwise, there is negligible chance.4)If pain is unbearable there is no choice for wait and watch. Anyway if you have consulted an or tho. Surgeon, He must have given you painkillers, if surely not you should consult him. I am not suggesting you any painkiller online, because I do not know your gastric history. Get well soon."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My 75 year old husband is over weight and has developed a very red and painful rash on his underbelly. He has type 2 diabetes. He experienced a very painful, and achy day yesterday. This was eventually relieved with E.S. Tylenol. Do you have any idea as to what this problem is?","Hello and Welcome to Ask a Doctor service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Perhaps he has shingles or herpes zoster. It presents as a band or stripe of red, painful rash which may become vesicular and ooze as well. Shingles is unilateral i.e. only one side of the body is affected.  It is due to reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV). Diabetes being a low immune state predisposes to reactivation. Specific treatment for shingles in the form of Oral antivirals like Val acyclovir helps shorten the episode besides also reducing the pain and severity of post herpetic neuralgia (PHN). I suggest you to kindly take him to a doctor in your vicinity for a confirmation of the diagnosis. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any more assistance."

He has mild diabetes. He has taken many medications but to not much effect. I have heard that 2500 micrograms of methylcobalamin injected with saline intrathecally gives good results. Also a cream called capsaicin also helps. Kindly advise the best medicine. Regards Kishore Bhargav,"Hi, First, your father should take vitamin B complex, twice a day after meals and one ampule vitamin B 12 every week, besides controlling the blood sugar. Moreover, the healthy diet is essential, he should avoid fat-rich diet and too much salt in diet. The regulation of the blood pressure is mandatory besides, checking kidney functions and his eyes every six months. He could take methylcobalamin 1000 micrograms oral once per day after meals. The injection dose is too high for him. Capsaicin cream is good for him when he suffers from pain. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

Itching might be due to elevated bilirubin levels and your liver test will show this if present. Since you have a history of bowel resection in 2003, it is possible that there are small developing adhesions in the bowel that is causing sub acute obstruction. This is responsible for the bowel obstructions you experience every 4 to 6 months.

I am very thin and do not eat fatty foods, however i do not exercise much because my MS has made it differcult.","Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that cholesterol target levels depends on some factors like your age and other associated rich factors like hypertension, diabetes and hereditary history of high cholesterol levels. Normal cholesterol level should be below 180 mg / DL and for LDL col below130 mg / DL. Cholesterol up to 235 is a high value, but you should not worry, you can correct it. The first recommendation is live style modification with dietary changes and regular physical activity minimal 40 minutes walking every day. If dietary modification and physical activity doesn't work than it might be a hereditary or genetic factor that keeps your cholesterol high and in these cases is essential to start medical treatment.

Please type your query here...My heart feels like its being squeezed and my arm goes numb on the left side - Ask a Doctor queries My heart feels like its being squeezed and my arm goes numb on the left side - Ask a Doctor queries","Brief Answer :Coronary Artery DeseaseDetailed Answer:Hello and thank you for question. I read very carefully your concerns. The sensation of heart squeezing followed by numbness of the left arm, in mos cases is caused by a problem of the heart vessels called coronary arteries. Usually the problem consists of their blockage due to atherosclerosis plaques that block. The blood flow inside the artery. In these cases the muscle of the heart it is not supplied with blood and oxygen, wich causes the death the cells of that part of the muscle. If that blockage of the artery persist for a long time, there are great chances of irreversible cell damages. In this situation it is better to ask some more specific question like: for how long do you feel this symptoms? How did they start? What you were doing when the symptoms started? Do you have difficulty in breathing? Do you suffer from any chronic condition, like diabetes etc.? First thing I would recommend doing an ECG (electrocardiogram) and a heart Ethnography. Also, to do some lab test like cardiac enzymes and a lipid panel. Please feel free to ask any other further question. Best regards!"

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi This Irfan MY ECG has yielded evidence of Inferior Wall Ischemic Changes (T Wave Inversion in III,aVF). My BP was also slightly high 150/90 and after 15 minutes it was recorded at 146/82. My blood sugar (non-fasting) was at 59.What exactly does it point to? Off late, I havent been able to have good sleep, lots of stress due to peculiar family circumstances.Please help.Thanks","Hello Iran. Thanks for posting at Chat Doctor. Your ECG says inferior wall ischemic changes which means that the lower part of the heart is struggling with its blood supply. It is possible that you have sustained a heart attack already. Since your sugars are low I suppose you are on medications for diabetes. Diabetics do not have symptoms of chest pain during a heart attack. You should definitely get checked up at the earliest. You have to see a cardiologist (heart specialist). Furthermore, you have to get a 2D echo done which will confirm the ECF findings if you really had a heart attack. If 2 d echo shows inferior wall changes then next step is an angiography which is an invasive procedure done through a small prick on your hand or leg. It will show whether your heart arteries have blockages and their severity. You may be advised angioplasty or bypass surgery or medical management on basis of angiography findings. This is important, and you should get evaluated at the earliest. Please revert with 2 d echo findings and also if you have any queries. Don't take this lightly. Your fasting sugars are also low, so you also have to monitor your sugars closelyWishing you good health. And skip respective dose if sugars are lower than 100. Also, you have to see your planetologist for medication optimization. Regards"

Thanks for being with us. There are two main types of kidney insult 1.acute 2.chronic. This can be easily distinguished if you have previous serum creatinine levels. If previous creatinine levels were normal, and you have been started with new onset symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, oliguria, burning or pus in urine or any new Chat Doctor. Acute kidney injury can be successfully treated, but this problem may be the start of chronic renal failure. If you are suffering from any chronic illness like hypertension, diabetes,poly cystic kidney disease, renal artery stenosis and your serum creatinine levels were high last time also then It's likely to be a chronic renal failure. There are lots of causes of acute and chronic kidney failure hence it's better to have an urgent nephrologist opinion as creatinine of 10.4 can be life-threatening, may lead to complications like hyperkalemia, azotemia, uremia, and you may need dialysis too. If you could have provided other lab findings like hemoglobin level, calcium,phosphorous, usg of kidney bladder ureter, blood pressure and sugar levels then I could have answered in more detail.

Childhood diabetes is of increasing concern in today's age and the only option to treat is to provide insulin from outside, in the form of injections.

If you have any additional risk factors such as diabetes, it would be important to control these as well. The low blood pressure readings may cause the lightheaded feeling. Nausea can be due to different causes such as :a side effect of medication, infections, alcohol, migraine, vertigo, liver disease, kidney disease.

If I undergo all the necessary process that is required of a donor, and shown compatible with his blood type; I exercise on regular basis would a transplant limit me from high intensity exercises?","Hello... My sympathies for the difficult situation you are in. After a kidney transplant, the donors remaining kidney takes over the function of both the kidneys to speak. Which means you have double the amount of blood flowing through it and double the amount of load that it needs to filter. The solitary kidney adapts to this need by undergoing an enlargement in size or hypertrophy. You should be able to maintain a normal lifestyle after the procedure. But you need to keep in mind that you will be at greater risk for diseases such as hypertension, anemia and osteodystrophy in the future. It would be better to avoid anything which would overload the solitary functioning kidney.(painkillers, high intake of salt and protein)It would be advisable that you maintain a healthy lifestyle and get a moderate amount of exercise, not high intensity on most days of the week.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am a 40-year-old, 159 pound, white female. I only smoked when I was a teenager occasionally and as a an adult, I would only smoke when I drank (which now I do not smoke at all). I drink occasionally on the weekends but not much. My father had a history of heart disease, emphysema and diabetes. He had his first heart attack in his mid-30s and had a triple bypass in 1983. At age 72, he passed away due to a massive heart attack he suffered as a result of the stress of having surgery to remove colon cancer. Over the past year or so I have been experiencing chest pains almost every day either at rest or after some activity. Sometimes when I am leaning over, I can get the pain in the center of my chest which can feel almost like muscle pain. Sometimes I experience the chest pains with a feeling of shortness of breath yet when I take a deep inhalation, it seems as though my breathing can be restored to normal. Sometimes with the chest pains I also experience some upper back pain across my shoulders. My neck, jaw and arms never really hurt or go numb. Oftentimes, I can feel my heart racing or feeling as though it is going to pound out of my chest. I have had numerous EKGs done all of which have come back normal. I went to the ER in February of 2009 and was admitted due to chest pains. Upon arrival at the ER, I had bloodwork done including my cardiac enzymes tested (which were all normal), an EKG done which was normal, BP (usually maintains at 112/80), pulse and heart rate were all normal. They kept me overnight so I could have a stress done. I completed that the next morning. The stress test I had was where they took pictures of my blood flow while at rest, then they shot me with some dye, then I ran on the treadmill and then more pictures were taken after that. The results were that I had a heart of a 28 year old, and I was in the top 90% of women my age. Then that afternoon, I had an endoscopy done to rule/out any gastro problems. That, too, was normal. I was seen by a cardiologist while an inpatient and he told me that everything was normal and it is very unusual of a woman my age, even with a family history, to have heart problems. It definitely was not a heart attack nor did he feel it was heart-related. Then I had an abdominal ultrasound completed outpatient which was normal as well as which was normal. I also wore a heart monitor for 30 days which allowed me to record all of my episodes. Upon review of that monitor, they told me I had sinus arrhythmia and tachycardia but there was nothing for me to do about it because it was nothing to worry about. My cholesterol is 195 and I can t remember my exact LDL or HDL but I believe the good cholesterol level was 5 points lower than it should be and the bad was good. My triglycerides were over 300 but at my last blood check they came down to a bit below 200. I am still working on lowering those. I know I do not always eat right nor do I exercise very often. I have cut back on fatty, greasy foods and am losing weight little by little. I continue to have these pains either at rest or after exerting myself. Sometimes I take Prilosec and the pain goes away. I mentally make the pain and heart pounding worse because I start to think there is something wrong with me that my PCP and the tests missed. (My PCP is my cousin who is very familiar with my family history and I truly believe he is doing everything possible to find an answer. Yet he keeps telling me that he is 99.9% sure it is NOT my heart. The only other thing he could do is a catheterization. He doesn t want to do it because there is a 1% risk that something could actually go wrong and cause me a real problem. He did say if I had the catheterization, it would completely give me a 100% answer. I actually gave myself such bad anxiety this past weekend that I actually started believing that I am dying or will die soon. These episodes and symptoms are driving me crazy! I want to hope that it is all just stress or something else. I ve been crazily reading things where they say sometimes people can sense doom or feel anxiety right before something bad like a heart attack or death happens. Please! Any help or answer you could give me to lead me in the right direction to solving my problem would be GREATLY appreciated. Janel M.","Hi, In my opinion we should first rule out lung related diseases for your chest pain and shortness of breath. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If PFT is normal then no need to worry about lung diseases.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My pleasure to meet you Dr. Rynne On Sept. 5, 2014 I suffered a heart attack and I had 3 stints placed and currently remains a 95% blockage in the main arota valve. I take several medications now, I eat right, exercise, rest and am trying not to have another heart attack. So my question to you is why is high altitude a issue with my health?","Hi, As you have mentioned that you had heart attack and also underwent coronary artery stenting (3 stents), there is likely possibility of compromised heart pumping (which can be assessed by 2DEcho, echocardiography by presence of regional wall motion abnormality and left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF).Also, you have aortic valve obstruction (stenosis) which you have mentioned as 95% blockage. Aortic valve stenosis is assessed by 2DEcho & color Doppler of heart by which we can know about valve size, pressure gradient generated across heart valve by obstruction, any concomitant leakage (regurgitation). You have to avoid situations that put extra work on heart.1) Physical or mental stress, which causes extra demand of blood and oxygen supply to body, which need to be fulfilled by extra work by heart which leads to increase in heart rate increased oxygen requirement there by increased blood supply to heart.2) High altitude: climbing to high altitude require physical exertion also oxygen content of air decreases with height, again at high altitude there is need for more oxygen by body and there by extra work on heart. In the presence of compromised heart pumping and significant aortic valve blockage heart can not generate adequate cardiac output (cardiac out put in simple term means blood volume pumped by heart in aorta per minute). In resting state cardiac output generated by such heart is sufficient to fulfill need for oxygen and blood of body. But when there is increased need for oxygen and blood supply of body, despite extra work heart cannot generate adequate cardiac output, and there is development of heart failure (let ventricular failure) which manifest as shortening of breath, breathlessness (doe to lung congestion), there may be swelling over legs, chest pain (heart attack). Then what should you do1) continue your blood thinning medicines, antiplatelet.2) keep in control your blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol levels if any abnormality there.3) use of diuretics that help in removing extra water from body and avoid lung congestion.4) use of medications like B blockers, ACE/Arms that help in preserving heart function.5) there may be need for aortic valve surgery, dilatation (vasectomy) or replacement (valvoplasty) depending on your symptomatology, pressure gradient across aortic valve, presence of concomitant aortic regurgitation. I think this information may be sufficient to solve your queries."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I had a MRI of my brain w/without contrast which states some foci of nonspecific increased signal in the periventricular and subcortical white matter particularly in the region of the right frontal parietal love but to a lesser extent in the white matter of the left frontal lob and right occipital lobe. What does that mean?,"Hello, Thanks for your queryFirst of all let me explain you that in Neurology Practice the interpretation of MRI should be done in a given clinical context.

Further the MRI findings will depend upon the age, gender and the presence /absence of other comorbid medical illness like high blood pressure, diabetes etched findings that you have described could be seen in 1. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease2. Desalinating disease3. Non-specific changes seen in the settings of migraine, Neurofibomatosis and so please donor worry much about the MRI findings only.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have had sex several times this month. We used a condum everytime and I am also on birth control. I try to take my birth control on time but I dont always take it at the exsact same time. I usually take it in atleast a half an hour difference than the usual time tho. I am supposed to be on my period currently it was supposed to come yesterday. But today all I have gotten was clear/white spit like consistancy fluid. It comes out quite often and I feel like I have my period because of cramps and achie pain. I have also noticed my blood sugar dropping very low through out the day. I have never noticed problems with my blood sugar before. Could I be pregnant?,"HI, I have read your query & understand your concern.  Blood sugar level depends on the food intake, Pregnancy does not have any effect on blood sugar. Except in case of diabetes/ gestational diabetes when blood sugar is raised in pregnancy. So low blood sugar can not be a sign of conception. Your blood sugar might have lowered due to psychological stress leading to less eating.  Yes, in pregnancy vaginal discharge is increased than normal, but it also increases before & after menses. So just rise in vaginal discharge can not be a sign of pregnancy.  Half hour difference in consumption of pill. Does not matter much. If you have not totally skipped a pill. In addition, you were using condom too. So there is rare chance of conception. Any doubt can be ruled out by HPT after 8 days delay in period.  Thanks."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have pain in the left side of my stomach that goes to my lower back,it also radiates to my lower abdomen and my left leg sometimes. I also feel nausea,sudden weakness, im hardly eating what use to and im using the bathroom more than twice for num 2.I also feel an urge to do num 1, even if i just finished","Hi. Thanks for your query. From the careful evaluation of your history; I can think of an inflammatory process going on in the left lower abdomen. The causes can be an inflamed mass, lymph nodes or a mass or abscess of the deep muscles like sons or so. The best way to get a diagnosis is :-Blood tests to determine the hemoglobin, WBC count for infection, blood sugar to rule out diabetes.-Urine test: routine, microscopy, culture and sensitivity to determine whether there is an associated urinary tract infection as a basic cause or secondary to the problems I have enumerated.-Ultrasonography of the abdomen to screen for the cause and -CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment will start as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines. Surgery will be needed if their as an indication for diagnosis and/ or therapeutic importance."

I thought Iincreased the walking too suddenly, but now wonder how this condition is interacting with diabetes/metformin?","Hi, I have read your problem. Usually back pain is managed with painkillers till 1-month period. If it persists beyond 1 month, then further investigations are done. Since you have a bad pain I will suggest the following: - Back pain can be due to many reasons, and it has probably no relation with your metformin alone but, if taken with statins then it may cause back pain. You should get x-ray lumbosacral spine done in AP and Lateral done send us report or discuss it with your doctor. Only then further management can be advised. - Avoid heavy weight lifting pushing and pulling heavy objects, because it will further increase back pain. - You can take medicine like painkillers + muscle relaxants by discussing it with your doctor. You may need stronger painkillers which are available on prescription only. You can try ibuprofen or naproxen till you see your doctor. - Apply hot packs for 30 min in morning and evening. I hope it helps. You are welcome to ask further health related queries. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.

Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. This is serious disease especially since cancer and cirrhosis are present concomitantly. The only possible cure in this case would be liver transplantation if he is fit enough. Liver resection may be beneficial if there is enough healthy liver tissue left.

This is necessary to prevent disease progression which is lethal in most cases. At early stages it can be treated with these measures, but surgery is required for cancer treatment.

I had gone through all the data you have posted. As you told your blood pressure is under good control you need to continue both medications for blood pressure. Kindly continue lifestyle modifications like avoid pickets, low salt, diet rich in fruits and vegetables, regular physical activity along with BP meds. Coming to cholesterol, as you said for triglycerides when they are very high we use medication to decrease to normal levels, and then you can stop medication for triglycerides, but you need to continue for LDL. It would have been helpful for us to decide if you have posted the full lipid profile report. DILATOR 10 what you were using might be a combination of atorvastatin + fenofibrate of which fenofibrate can be stopped and atorvastatin should be continued 1 tab daily night. Common reason for elevated triglycerides are eating oily foods, alcohol, diabetes and hypothyroidism. So thyroid treatment can be continued, decrease the oil food content, quit alcohol so that TG levels may not rise after stopping tablet. Continue regular physical activity. Hope this helps..."

In fact his sickness has never come under control. To see that blood sugar level has come to normal range is no cure. Disease has to be understood in a dynamic form which is gradually worsening for the last 18 years or more. Since your fathers' disease is becoming worse, he is now developing the complication called Diabetic Neuropathy. The burning sensation is a symptom of that.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have been having dizzy spells and issues with my balance for about 6 months. Sometimes the balance gets quite bad, I have never fallen but it is uncomfortable and has caused me much anxiety. I had migraines daily for 40 days, they have since stopped this was in the middle of the spells (so 3 months in). I have lower blood pressure, and have always had this. I had a full cardiac workup a year and a half ago (I was having dizzy spells but not the balance problems). When this started I felt like a wave of dizzy came up from my neck and was centralized in my left quadrant frontal of my head. I saw a neurologist at this point referred to by my GP and he couldn t find anything wrong and thought it was just unexplained sensations. My GP thought maybe seizures. After having the bout of recurring migraines I did have an MRI whicChatDoctore back normal. I am at a loss as I am still having these issues. My GP put me on Zoloft as it created anxiety but also perhaps is caused by anxiety. I don t feel this is anxiety. I also have sensations in my left calf which are either heightened or dulled (numb) in the inner medial portion and sometimes a buzzing sensation in my groin and foot. I am worried that there is something neurologically wrong with me that the MRI missed.","Hi, Diagnosing balance issues and dizzy spells is difficult. One important thing to rule out is cardiac reasons. Another important aspect is central nervous system reasons. It is great that you already tested for both that and the results came back normal.  From your description. I think this could be a case of polyneuropathy. The peripheral nerves sending feedback about balance are the first to be affected with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, or it B12 deficiencies.  If I were your treating physician after detailed history and physical examination I would ask for blood tests including it. B12 levels, HbA1C, fasting glucose.  I would refer you to do a caloric ear test also, which provide an idea of the function of the balance center in the ear.

During the ""window"" from Diagnosis of brain aneurysm to the actual surgery, you need to take extreme care. High blood pressure, severe pain, even emotional stress can cause it to rupture. I suggest, you make an appointment with the neurosurgeon at the earliest. An unruptured brain aneurysm without neurological deficits has excellent results as compared to an already ruptured one. Your diabetes is not a problem, that will be controlled anyway during and after the surgery. I reiterate, your aneurysm is of paramount importance. Make an appointment as soon as possible. Hope this helps!"

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","When my son visited a couple of weekends ago, I was shocked to see that over two thirds of his upper back was covered by what appears to be a large solid scab, or some kind of fungal growth. when I appeared shocked and questioned him, he seemed embarrassed (of course I am his mother) and dismissed it as nothing. He is Sixty two and grossly overweight, but always very clean and well groomed.","Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor !  I have gone through your question and understand your concern.  The cause of scab is unclear with no medical history (like if the patient is diabetic or hypertensive or currently on any medications or history of family allergies etc.). However, a few causes considering the age and obesity can be enlisted. The most common on the list is fungal infection which you already suspect. Fungal infection can cause intense itch which eventually cause scab formation and may also leave a hyperpigmented patch over the area. Fungal infections are not due to unhygienic personal habit in most cases. In obese it could be the underlying diabetes, low immunity, excess sweating or even frequent use of antibiotics to treat other infections. It could even be a scab from healed decubitus ulcer. Decubitus ulcers appear to be more prevalent in obese patients who spend above average time on their backs. Wound healing is also slow in obese patients and even boils over the skin tend to stay infected for a long period of time with slow healing rate. Psoriasis also occurs more frequently in obese, but the reasons for this are unclear. These are only few causes, they are plenty others. Obesity and skin infections can cause low self-esteem and depression which will prevent the patient from seeking any medical help. My advice is to ad Chat Doctor.  At your visit expect a few basic tests like blood sugars, ESR, thyroid levels and physical examination before concluding the underlying cause after which treatment will be initiated.  Hope this clarifies you concern. Thank you for the query. Take care "

I would like to explain that Cool/HDL ratio is a more confident indicator compared to total cholesterol or LDL. A ratio above 4.5 in men, indicates a high cardio vascular risk. That is why I agree with your doctor in starting therapy with statins to reduce this independent risk factor for cardio vascular disease. Regarding his glucose levels, I would advise performing further tests like : - glucose tolerance test- HbA1c to examine better his glucose metabolism and rule in/out possible diabetes. In case of an initial diabetes, diet modifications would be more appropriate than medical therapy, to reduce high blood glucose levels. Some other tests are needed to exclude other metabolic disorders: - a resting ECG-thyroid function tests-cortisol plasma levels-blood electrolytes-kidney and liver function tests.

As for the small vessel disease that is a coincidental finding, is not related to the trauma or those symptoms.

Take oral anti-inflammatory muscle relaxants for few days. I think it should settle down. Failure of settling of pain would necessitate further investigation for the cause. As far as your high sugars are concerned, rib fracture has no role in it.

Increased ALT may indicate liver injury. It may be due to many reasons like hepatitis, alcohol intake, altered lipid profile, medicines,autoimmune causes etc. In your mothers case, increased ALT may be related to mildly increased cholesterol level and obesity.

I m a diabetic (2) and I just want to know if Ceftin is a good antibiotic for this illness.. and how long will it take before I should feel better?","Sepsis is a bacterial infection in the blood. It often starts in the urinary tract. It can be caused by many types of bacteria. The correct antibiotic to cure it depends on the type of bacteria you have. Since you were in the hospital, they did tests to diagnose the type of bacteria and to see what antibiotics it is susceptible to. In that case, you would initially be treated with IV antibiotics, and when the infection was under control, you would be switched to oral antibiotics. Typically, the oral antibiotics would be the same or similar to the IV ones were, so the Certain should be a good antibiotic in your case. You can have residual effects after such a serious illness for some days or weeks afterward. You should also be keeping a close eye on your diabetes control as sepsis could upset it and poorly controlled diabetes also reduces your immunity. Hope this helps."

Pigmentation around the eyes could be due to various factors including familial, thin skin around the eyes, diabetes mellitus, deep eye sockets, stress and lack of sleep.

I m pretty sure I don t have an STI , as i have safe sex , and this has been a problem before I had any sexual activity. Reading other article it was suggested that this could be diet related or even due to diabetes , I don t have diabetes and restricted my diet to low sugar, and this had no effect.

Could this be linked and should i be worried?","Hi there, Thanks for asking. You have a careful observation. Change in personality (and also aggressiveness as you mentioned), as well as change in smell, may be induced by tumors (benign or malignant) in front part of the brain. Weakness in one part of the face and on one side of your body are also important focal signs which may contribute to a mass effect (like benign tumors) or vascular event (like shortage of circulation to your brain). It is necessary that a full neurologic examination will be done by your doctor to see what issue might be responsible for your problem. Headaches due to a mass are often more prominent in the early morning. Vascular problems are often seen in hypertensive people who may also have high cholesterol level and diabetes.

I am a 58 year old woman in good health; I eat well and get regular exercise. Thanks","Hi, Thanks for your query. The abnormal sensations that you have such as burning, tingling are termed peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral Neuropathy is a condition caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system [most commonly seen in diabetic patients]. Another possibility could be nerve compression in spine due to disc bulge. Change your diet and remove inflammatory foods such as citrus fruits, dairy products and wheat that may aggravate the condition. Simultaneously increase your intake of potassium and calcium-rich foods such as bananas and avocados and green leafy vegetablesVitamin B12 is important in the maintenance of health and normal functioning of the nerve tissue and deficiency of it can lead to numbness.

My friend has been struggling for a week or two now with her blood pressure not coming down - it goes higher with each visit to the doctor. The latest result was about 170/150 ! The doctor says he does not know what is wrong and she even went for a second opinion, with the same answer. Medication is not helping and blood sugar also elevated - 11. What could the cause be ?","Hello, Brief answer: Persistent high blood pressure needs control and follow-up, blood sugar alone cannot diagnose diabetes. Explanation: My opinion is that persistent high blood sugar on multiple occasions in and out of doctor's office is a diagnosis of hypertension that needs to be controlled by lifestyle modification, exercise and if not, medication. Random blood sugar alone is not good enough to diagnose diabetes. Other tests like oral glucose tolerance test and hemoglobin A1C are essential to diagnose (one of them is good). Also, if diagnosed needs to be controlled first with lifestyle, some medications like Metformin or maybe more, and that according to type of diabetes, age, risk factors, etc. I suggest my people the following measure blood pressure at home with a good technique and that you can check on YouTube videos. Do other tests like HBA1C, lipid profile, etc. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about risk factors, smoking, and anxiety issues. Conclusion: I suggest you home blood pressure monitoring and recheck you medication with your doctor. Do other tests to be sure of diabetes. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

If you can provide me more details like medical history like if you are having diabetes or liver diseaseSimilar complaints in the past, I will be able to guide you better. If I were your treating doctor, I would have advised you to keep it clean and apply antiseptic ointment if it doesn't improve or worsens than I would have ordered few investigations like blood for hemoglobin, CBC Liver and kidney function test, blood sugar and urine culture or an ultrasound if need be.

Doctr has given aplazaar 2tab trice a day and two days back suggested for espogen 4000 once a week. Hemoglobin is 10.2. Is the medicine ok to avoid dialysis.,"Hi, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is due to persistent underlying disease like diabetes, uncontrolled high blood pressure, untreated kidney stones, rarely it may develop as a consequence to AKA (Acute Kidney Injury). In your fathers' case I want to know-1) Presence of Diabetes, Blood pressure, Cholesterol problems if any and treatment taken for it.2) Any habits like smoking, alcohol. Stage of CKD depends on EFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) it depends upon Age, gender, serum creatinine, weight. Treatment of CKD is to prevent or to slow the process of deterioration of kidney function. It requires-1) Diet with adequate vegetarian proteins.2) Control of Diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol.3) Avoidance of nephrotoxic food and medicines like pain killers4) Water intake needs to be restricted if there is tendency to retain water.5) Low Potassium intake (avoid intake of fruit and fruit juices, coconut water) in case there is potassium retention in body.6) Maintain calcium, phosphorus, uric acid levels under control.7) Avoid smoking, alcohol. 8) Screening for complication on heart. As you have mentioned your father has got stroke it means he is at increased risk for other vascular events like heart attack (coronary artery disease)Regarding medicines you have mentioned-APLAZAAR: it is a nutritional supplement containing amino acids and other nutrients for kidney that help in containing kidney function but not necessarily it will avoid dialysis. SPOKEN: It contains erythropoietin a hormone needed for hemoglobin formation and is produced by kidney. It is used in CKD because deterioration of kidney function is associated with decreased production of erythropoietin and low hemoglobin. Treatment of CKD is to prevent or to slow the process of deterioration of kidney function. It requires-1) Diet with adequate vegetarian proteins.2) Control of Diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol.3) Avoidance of nephrotoxic food and medicines like pain killers4) Water intake needs to be restricted if there is tendency to retain water.5) Low Potassium intake (avoid intake of fruit and fruit juices, coconut water) in case there is potassium retention in body.6) Maintain calcium, phosphorus, uric acid levels under control.7) Avoid smoking, alcohol. Need for Hemodialysis depends on on-1) Amount of Urine production daily.2) Serum electrolyte mainly Potassium.3) Serum Creatinine level.4) Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis which denote degree of acid accumulation in blood.5) Signs of water retention like breathing difficulty, swelling over body, puffiness of face."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My husband & I left Mass. Sunday to attend an Army reunion in Myrtle Beach.  He has diabetes and associated problems but has been fairly healthy.  I drove on Sunday. Monday (Sept 30) he drove all morning; after having lunch he had trouble standing up & his speech was slurred.  Another patron helped me get him into the car.  It was clear that something was happening; I called 911 and an ambulance met us near Rt. 95 S at Ashland, VA and took him to Mem. Regional Med Ctr in Mechanicsville, near Richmond.  He underwent many, many tests, including MRI.  The diagnosis was probable TIA, accompanied by diabetes & hypertension.  All tests were normal for a 79 yr old man.  We asked for him to be discharged as he seemed back to normal, and we left hosp. Tuesday evening at 5 pm, arriving in Myrtle Beach about 11 pm.  On Wed (yesterday) there was another incident, with trouble walking and slurred speech, yet he was able to carry on a normal conversation.  After sleeping 2-3 hours, he was doing well--we went out with our group for the evening.  He slept well all night.  This morning, 2 hours after awakening, he again couldnt stand up and couldnt sit in his chair without slumping off.  For about 1/2 hour he could not smile on the left side; he could touch his nose with rt hand but couldnt move his left hand.  When we tried to get him into a wheelchair, he slumped down to the floor; 3 men helped him into the chair and back to our room, where he has slept for the rest of the day (about 1 pm until 7 pm; I woke him at 5:15 and he was able to sit up and walk to the bathroom with my help, then back to bed, again with my help.  I had thought that after resting, he would bounce back enough to get up and join the group, like last night.  That is not happening.  Now my concern is, should I take him to a hospital here in Myrtle Beach (I would probably need to get an ambulance to do that), have his friends help me get him into our car and drive 5-6 hours back to the hospital where they saw him Mon-Tues, try to drive him all the way home to Mass., etc.  I really dont know what is in his best interest right now.Thank you.Jeanne Johnson","Hello, Your husband is having recurrent TIA, and it is almost like a completed stroke. It is a very dangerous situation and needs urgent hospitalization, treatment and investigations to find the exact cause. Treatment is done by antiplatelet therapy, statins,ACE inhibitors, anti coagulants etc. Carotid artery circulation has to be evaluated and if obstruction is found, then surgery may be done. MRI brain is required to look for any hemorrhage or infarction. Best of luckThanks"

Thanks for the opportunity for helping you. As per your description this fits your assumption of cellulitis though I would like to get few more informations1) did you get your sugars checked recently. If not kindly get your sugars checked, fasting blood sugars as well as postprandial blood sugar levels. If you have recently developed diabetes then your immunity will be lowed, and you might get cellulitis due to streptococcal infection or klebsiella or pseudocodes infection.2) kindly get a total count done which will guide you regarding the extent of infection and help in considering your decision to wait till your appointment. Kindly enlighten me about any history of injury over the affected site.

Sudden stopping of breathing and urge to breath normal air is seen in1. Sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)2.

Incomplete data like the BP readings are not mentioned & for how long you have been having this problem.First I would like to say Meganeuron is not used in the treatment of high BP.

For your high BP I would advise you to consult a physician for proper evaluation and certain lab tests like fasting blood glucose (to rule out diabetes), serum lipid levels, kidney function tests and ECG.

As per your description, he has got blockages in all the three arteries of the heart. In this case a bypass surgery is advice. But as he is 84, the risks and benefits of the surgery must be weighed. Also, other things that matter are associated health issues like diabetes, blood pressure, kidney issues etc. The decision for bypass surgery also depends on where exactly the arteries are blocked i.e. very close from their origin or distal from their origin. Another important factor is his expectations and his desire. I don't know him personally, but you must ask him what he wants to pursue, what type of activities he expects himself to do. I would not advise a bypass surgery for him at this age. It is putting him at more trauma and discomfort. One approach can be angioplasty to stent only those arteries which are more critically blocked and can cause a life threat. Rest can be left upon medical management. Second approach will be a trial of medical management. He may remain asymptomatic with medications and can go around with his daily activities. I need to watch his angiography pictures to comment more. Information can be availed all over the internet with a simple search, but those searches do not take into account his age, his personal preference and many other factors.

Glandular fever is something which is caused by a viral infection. It just requires symptomatic treatment with antiviral medication. It's not a serious infection. Less than 5% cases go in for a complication. But your sons high glucose values raise the suspicion of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Also his symptoms like excessive thirst and tiredness also suggest such a diagnosis. It is mandatory to get him examined and rule out the diagnosis by measuring glucose levels and insulin levels. Type 1 DM is a lifelong disease and have the lot of complications can develop. He may have to take lifelong insulin supplements. Convince him about the seriousness of the disease, so he will agree for the diagnostic work up. Please revert with further reports and queries."

Does diet play a part in his ups and downs????","Hi, diet plays very important role in all diabetes and heart patients. e.g. if pt Is on diabetic medicines.

I went through your query and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Side effects of corticosteroids are numerous - obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cataract, glaucoma, reduced immunity, gastritis, reduced libido, osteoporosis, personality changes, etc. etc. However, such side effects are more commonly seen with oral steroids. They are seen only with long term use of high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Gargling after each use also reduces absorption of steroids into body as you have been already doing.2. Common side effects of inhaled corticosteroids are oral thrush, change in voice, local irritation, etc. 3. However, it is always preferable to try to reduce dose of inhaled corticosteroids as much as possible. Were I treating you, I would add montelukast in your regular treatment, which may reduce your inhaled corticosteroid requirements.4. I would also suggest you allergy testing, which will help you identify the substances causing symptoms to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.5. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve your allergy symptoms.6. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc.) will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively and thereby reducing inhaled corticosteroid requirements on a long run. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."

She is diabetic which has been kept under control.She has started walking with walker in her Flat. But there is excessive pain below knee to Toe throughout the Day. Temporary relief is felt from Hot water Rubber Bottle. She does not get sound sleep during Night time. So we tried one tablet of Crocin / Calpol-650mg before Bed time. She got some relief from pain and is able to sleep. Can we give same dose Daily before Bed time without any adverse effects..","Hi, Thanks for posting your query. With the available described symptoms, there could be possibility of articular pain running from thigh to toes due to compression on nerve roots. You should consult with your treating doctor/ internal medicine specialist/ neurologist and should go for thorough neurological check up. There could also be possibility of persisting inflammation at hip replacement site. As such there is no harm in taking single dose of Cronin/ Cal pol at nighttimes. But she should go for renal function test before using cal pol as diabetes is associated with renal function derangement. If renal function test is found to be normal then she can use cal pol safely. She should also take cholecalciferol sachet once in a week. Take care,"

The swelling is because of the extension of the tooth infection to the tissue spaces(space infection). The amoxicillin alone will not be effective in this condition, you need to take a combination of amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 400 mg TID for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Meanwhile you can start up with root canal treatment. Once the canals are opened the pus will reduce and swelling will come down.

Also, you check your blood pressure frequently and maintain the chart. Sometimes low BP also lead to same. Try to take pulse rate reading during lightheadedness, it shouldn't be very high like 140-150. Avoid spicy and fatty foods. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","After a lifetime of issues with my teeth and constant micro infections and painful cavities, I finally was able to get on dental insurance through the state.  The dentist, who I picked for his high reviews for successfully treating scared patients, and I discussed my options and the best seemed to be complete removal of all my remaining teeth (7 on top and 10 on bottom as all back teeth had been previously pulled over the years). Id then get a full set of dentures, also through the state. Four weeks ago,  I had the top teeth extracted which went in a line from my left canine, my front teeth, and then ended with the tooth just behind my right canine.  Im still getting painful twinges in the areas formerly occupied by my front teeth and canines if I do any sort of activity, plus my face is still really store from the left canine removal up into my sinus area when I press gently on my face.  My dentist has checked and said it appears Im healing with no sign of infection, but Im concerned.  The state insurance wont pay for me to see another dentist. Is this sort of painful twinging normal?","Hi, Thank you for your query on Chat Doctor I understood your concern. Since you already discussed the options with your dentist and had chosen the removal of all the teeth, you will wear new dentures and that may be the better option since your teeth as said is agitated much. High sugary diet, sticky sugar foods, uncontrolled diabetes, poor oral hygiene etc. causes cavities on teeth. Controlling these factors can prevent cavities. Once agitated, if mild, the teeth can be treated by normal restoration. If it reaches pulp, ACT. If severe or grossly decayed, then extraction is the choice followed by prosthodontist (implants or normal complete dentures)Also clinical check up by your dentist showed no infection, so need to worry, pain subsides gradually. It may take time since many teeth are extracted and the soft tissues got irritated. Take an X-ray of the extracted site where you feel pain and get confirmed if there is any real cause for pain. Even if there is any very small harm to sinus wall, it will heal up. Don't worry. But if pain continues for more than a month, do a thorough check-up. Hope this information help. Thank you"

Anyway I recently got diagnosed with cellulitus due to a scratch by my dog. I am on Augmentin the highest dose 875-125mg twice daily, my question is this can Augmentin cause nerve damage? Other then the cellulitus I have been having health issues but doctors think its anxiety/panic attacks. Anyway I haven t slept really for 8 days, I was having panic attacks in my sleep. I recently started taking the augmentin (day 3 in the morning) and I feel worse, YES the swelling in my arm is going down but I am having back pain , bad tension headaches, (I have been having weakness only on my right side for about 3 months now in the middle of testing) and also starting today (2 days into the antibiotic) my feet ( both) feel very stiff its unvonfortable sitting for to long (can this be caused by not sleeping or something else??) and my legs are weak and I can not stabd for very lobg my back hurts, and I get dizzy. But strangly when moving my feet feel a BIT better. But now a frightening new symptom appeared and I don t know if it is from the Augmentin (this NEVER happened to me before.) My right ring finger is bent and doesnt want to straighten but can be straightened if I really try to but just resting it it remains in a bent shape ( not at the tip the bend is more towards the middle and bottom) and now my fingers from time to time spread out the dont stay side by side when I m resting my hand it doesn t really hurt its just very annoying and when I squeeze stuff it s very week and I can t squeeze that hard (this problem with my hand is only the right one) also it feels like an electric shock going through my hand and fingers when I do tasks with it it s overall weak but the ring finger is VERY weak and can t do anything with it (what can this be I m nervous!) also I have had tests for Lyme (negative), a bunch if blood tests to do with my heart (fine), anemia (fine), Mono (negative) no diabetes, and I have had 2 EKG S both fine.

Sorry this is so long I really appreciate your help and time!","Hi, you are using augmenting for cellulitis, but you are experiencing headache, backache, panic in sleep, dizzy, feet stiff, etc., every test of all systems are fine.  Most probably the changes are due to the allergic reaction of the augmenting, and also due to the gastric irritation.  As the Chat Doctor.  I to my patient with such symptoms prescribe omeprazole, risperidone, and antacid gel. If some changes persists you can go for exchange of the antibiotic. Thank you."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",We just found out about the contents of a MRI report for my husband and the doctors never discussed it with us and we need some direction as what follow up would be best. Report reads: several scattered foci of increased signal within bilateral parietal high to mid convexity white matter. Corresponding increased T2 signal within these regions on FLAIR imaging. What could this mean? My husband does have impaired memory since his illness both retrograde and anterograde covering areas of memory from all ages,"I read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. Imaging studies often can't be interpreted alone without other data though, because interpretation depends on many factors like age and accompanying conditions. That report speaks of changes which are not specific and could have many origins. Most commonly they are seen with advancing age especially when there are conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes etc. due to chronic changes in your small blood vessels (but some changes do occur with age even in the absence of those other conditions). So if your husband is an elderly person your doctor didn't discuss it with you because he considered it a normal finding. There may be other causes like past trauma, past infection etc. If there are other additional data you can provide feel free to ask again and me or my colleagues might give a more precise answer. I hope to have been of help."

Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that your blood sugar levels are high. How many hours after eating did you perform the blood test? I would recommend performing a fasting glucose and a glucose tolerance test, including HbA1C to exclude the possibility of diabetes. From the other hand your blood pressure seems to be OK, but your heart rate is a little high. Do you have any symptoms like palpitations, chest discomfort, shortness of breathing? Regarding the blueish feet and the headache, these symptoms could be related to an inflammatory disease, to a viral infection. Do you have any fever? A peripheral arthropathy can not be excluded as the possible cause of the changes in the color of your feet. I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical examination and some tests: -resting ECG-chest X-ray study-Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels-blood lab tests: complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope you will find THS answer helpful! Feel free to ask any other questions whenever you need! Best regards!"

The classical diabetic symptoms are excessive urine production, weight loss and excessive thirst. You should definitely do a fasting blood glucose test. Did you have gestational diabetes?

Proteins should be reduced but please suggest a diet which is also tasty so that it is easy for her to follow and varied if possible.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. As cholesterol is 357, food must be cooked with less oil. If possible please use olive oil for cooking. Salt must be given in little quantities with no extra salt serving. With a creatinine of 4.5, a lower protein diet to minimize waste products in the blood might help. As her body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that the kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work her kidneys must do, eating less protein might be good.

Give small servings and since she also has diabetes please give her a diet with balanced carboy Chat Doctor.  Bread can be substituted for rice.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I m a runner and a cyclist, and compete in races (less so in the last 1-2 years....). I m fairly competitive in these events and usually place in the top 5% or better. Two years ago, I was taking gabapentin for nerve injury from a car wreck. My muscles had extreme fatigue from exercise, my knees hurt, my eyes occasionally had blurry vision, and I had leg cramps. I stopped the medicine and my symptoms improved, but did not all completely go away. It seemed that I tired more easily and did not recover as quickly. I had a few races where 2/3 of the way through the race, it felt like I had hit the wall in a marathon -- I was out of energy. A year ago, I had some pitting edema and pain in my foot/toes. The edema got somewhat better, but I don t believe that it ever went away. My current condition is that I fatigue more quickly in exercise, and I ve noticed it more in races and/or hilly routes. And my knees are sore, which is especially noticeable when on the stairs. I noticed that the pitting edema is back (or perhaps never really went away completely). I m not sure if this is related to my problems or not, but I also had what seems to have been plantar fascitis in August. It had bothered me only in the morning for a while, but got so bad that it hurt walking on it. A cortisone shot seemed to help, but it took about 3 weeks before I noticed improvement. I noticed earlier this year that my arch doesn t seem as high as it used to be -- mostly it s just the sensation of being able to feel it touching the floor when I m standing barefoot. I never used to feel that -- perhaps it s some swelling. I don t know. Recent blood test showed TSH of 5.41. The doctor says that is in the normal range of 0.5 to 6.0. CpK was somewhat elevated (around 250). I m 48 years old. 6 3 and about 195 pounds. Suggestions?","Hi, From what I have read I think the issue is cardiovascular in origin rather than neurological. Symptoms like fatigue after exercise and edema point to a cardiac related issue.  If I were your treating physician I would start with ECG, and stress induced ECG's, Echocardiogram, x-ray of the chest.  I would measure your blood pressure and ask you to keep a diary for blood pressure. I would also order blood tests to rule out diabetes, high cholesterol level, kidney function tests.

Regards Kareem - Sydney","Thanks for posting your concern on Chat Doctor! I have gone through your case, since you have stopped taking alcohol for the past two years it looks unlikely that the raised enzymes are due to alcohol related liver injury. In view of your body weight, there may be a possibility of having fatty liver that might have caused the elevation of liver enzymes. So, get the ultrasound done to confirm or rule out the fatty liver. You have some sort of sedentary type of lifestyle which most time almost 6 hours you have to be seated in front of computer that also can cause an increase in body weight. You have to change your lifestyle, like go for daily walk for about 30 minutes, avoid consuming fast and junk foods, oily foods, eat a lot of vegetables and fresh fruits as they contain anti oxidants that will prevent the liver damage.

You are doing the right thing now. What you are experiencing is something called reactive hypoglycemia. It indicates that you are at risk for developing diabetes.

You need to lose weight take frequent meals and exercise regularly. Your get and FBS will be normal as you are not diabetic yet. It's a problem with the pattern of insulin release. Normally its pulsatile but one at risk for diabetes looses this year's earlier causing such symptoms. Don't worry. You will do well with this management.

It seems that you have delayed resolution of pneumonia. Inappropriate antibiotics or poor patient compliance, suboptimal dose, incomplete treatment, Chat Doctor. Immunocompromised patient -decreased host resistance like diabetes mellitus, chronic alcoholism, Agranulocytosis, hypogamaglobulianemia, elderly and debilitated patient are other contributing factors in different cases. Since your response to treatment is slow, co-morbidities need to be ruled out.However, a prolonged course of suitable antibiotic /s will likely to resolve the problem. Regards "

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","A brain MRI finding is in part: The ventricles, cisterns, and other CSF containing spaces are diffusely prominent secondary to parenchymal volume loss. This is stable. There are confluent periventricular and patchy subcortical foci of increased signal on T2/FLAIR sequences consistent with gliosis secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. These are stable. 1. What does this mean? 2. I am 85 years old, and about three months ago experienced an acute brain allergic reaction to a medication I was given. At that time, for about three weeks, I was confused and felt demented. Since then, I have largely recovered but feel some mild persisting reduction in intellectual functioning. My wife and I are considering moving from our present large single-family home to a senior-living community. Should we, considering the MRI findings, give preference to facilities equipped to deal with mental decline? If so, how much?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. The MRI scan brain is as explained below. Brain shows changes due to aging and this has been written are prominent ventricles and cisterns and also reduce brain volume. This is not a serious condition and is an expected finding in the elderly. Confluent periventricular T2 and FLAIR increased signal intensities is due to partial effects of decreased blood flow through the small arteries in the brain. This is nothing serious and can be seen in many people. This happens earlier in those having diabetes and hypertension. The acute brain allergic reaction is not responsible for all your finding in the brain. There is no requirement to seek additional facilities to deal with mental decline if you have made a near complete recovery from the confused and demented state you have had previously. Since you are 85 years old, a little amount of brain volume loss and ischemic small vessel changes are in line and not a big concern if thinking of moving to a community facility for elderly."

However, metabolic problems (e.g.diabetes) should be ruled out through blood tests (fasting blood glucose test, hormonal balance).

The result is there is presence of albumin , 30-35/hpf pus cells, and 8-10/hpf red blood cells. I just want to know what can be the cause of this problem? Is this situation called albuminuria and is there any danger or problem in the functioning of my kidneys?","Hi, Thanks for choosing ChatDoctoryes it is urinary tract infection(UTI)presence of albumin in urine is called luminaria...but if it is in traces, you need not worry because it stops when the infection subsides Do you get UTI frequently?because if it is so, urine might have gone up in the urinary tract towards the kidneys and damages its tissue leading to scars.... what is your age?any history or family history of diabetes and hypertension?please get these checked up and take proper treatment because in diabetes, proteinuria is seen and hypertension(BP) may also be due to kidney damage don't worry Chat Doctor. That is wrong .........because though your symptoms subside some infection is still present which flares up after you stop taking medicine, and it also causes resistance so that the antibiotic will not be effective when you use the next time(even if you take a bigger dose) so take care, talk to the doctor and take up all tests needed get an ultrasound abdomen (scan)done if suggested.

I get really bad shooting pains once in a while that causes my whole leg to convulse. It s been that way for about 7 years. The pain comes mostly when it s subjected to wind or cold weather.,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should definitely consult doctor and get done clinical examination of your right maxilla. Recurrent lumps, discharging fluid etc. are more suggestive of lymph node enlargement and discharging sinuses. This is commonly seen with tuberculosis and other bacterial infection. So get done microscopic examination of discharge and ultrasound examination of maxilla. If lymph nodes are enlarged then you will need fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Also rule out diabetes because uncontrolled sugar levels can also cause such discharge. For your leg pain, get done x-ray of lumber spine to rule out nerve root compression. Consult doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

Coronary angioplasty is one of the therapeutic options proposed to the patient after coronary angiography. The degree of stenosis is a primordial argument, but it is not the only one. Even if coronary stenosis is considered significant (> 70%), the decision to perform coronary angioplasty should correlate to other factors: - The clinical status (chest pain) - electrical modification (st+ and st-) - enzymatic elevation - Evidence of myocardial ischemia provided by the upstream examinations and which often motivated coronary angiography (stress test, scenography). The indications for coronary angioplasty have been widened by the effectiveness of anti-aggregation treatments (reduction of the risk of thrombosis) but also technical advances (in particular active stents). At present angioplasty is often an alternative to surgery. Decisions and discussions are made on a case-by-case basis to enable the patient to benefit from the best therapeutic option for myocardial revascularization. For complex cases (multi-truncular, diabetic ...), cardio logical societies have developed decision-making tools such as EuroS core or Syntax Score. These scores make it possible to choose objectively the therapeutic option with the best ""benefit-risk"" for the patient. The risks associated with the prolonged antiaggregant combination associated with active stents lead them to prefer in many cases bare metal stents, which require only a much shorter anti-aggregation treatment.  Active stents are of interest only to selected patients, in case of monotone lesions with a high risk of restenosis with lesions more than 15 mm or diameter of the vessel reached less than 3 mm or diabetes. Or in the case of first instent-restenosis of a bare metal stent, total coronary occlusion, stenosis of left unprotected common core or multi-renal lesions with a high risk of restenosis, Angioplasty is preferred to surgery (CABG or Coronary artery bypass grafting) after medico-surgical discussion. I urge you to accept the suggested method by your doctor"

I have not injured my leg, but I do have OA in my hip and not sure if that might play a role! The swollen area is sore to the touch and also produces sharp pains after I have been on my legs for a while. What could it be?","Hello, Due to OA hip, there will be a change in the gait cycle and due to which there might be additional strain over the knee joint leading to joint stress.  This should be a secondary complication to OA Hip. Using ice for reducing swelling and pain is advice only if you do not have any other medical pathology like diabetes. If you have diabetes than avoid icing and use hot water fermentation. Also, check for many signs of vascular insufficiency like varicose veins. If absent than then soreness is just a muscle strain.

I have been given imodium, biscopan, nexium and recently Amitriptyline. My doctor doesnt know whats going on or how to manage this, do you?","HI. Severe stomach pains and cramps associated with severe bouts of watery stool movements may be due to gastroenteritis. Get the stool, blood and urine tested, also blood sugar to rule out diabetes, thyroid functions. Continue the medicines you have. Imodium should be taken only after a bout of loose stool and 6 capsules in 24 hours as a maximum dose. Do not take more than sic capsules. Adding a proper antibiotic against the intestinal bacteria and metronidazole should have helped you. Treatment of the primary medical problem if exists is a must. Amitryptilin has no role in such conditions, and you may please stop this in consultation of your Doctor. IF there is no relief, colonoscopy and CT scan of the abdomen may be needed.

I appreciate your concern regarding this issue and I shall help where I can. There are a few issues that need to be excluded here, but you would have to see your GP in order to perform the correct tests. By doing so you will be able to determine the cause of your symptoms, and you can then receive the appropriate management for it. A simple test could be done to your urine called a dipstick test where a test strip is used to determine whether they are any abnormalities with the urine. If there is blood in the urine then further investigations will need to be done such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out kidney stones for example. The test would also be able to pick up if there are any signs of infection which could also be causing your symptoms. Other products such as glucose and proteins can also be detected in the urine this way and if so, further investigations will have to be done to rule out other systemic problems such as diabetes and liver related pathology. I hope this helps and good luck."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi. Me and my husband have been trying to get pregnant since september. We were successful in January and at 9 weeks I had a miscarrage. I am an athlete and I have really took a step back with working out. I am a vegetarian but eat fish, and I do like to drink wine on occasion usually with dinner. I am getting frustrated with trying every month and learning that I am once again unsuccessful with getting pregnant. So my question is does it take longer to get pregnant after a miscarriage? And do you have any advice on what else I could do.","Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion there are good scopes of getting pregnancy. Because you had already got previous pregnancy spontaneously. But the cause for miscarriage should be evaluated and should be prevented from repeating in further pregnancy. The various causes for pregnancy loss in 1st trimester are genetic anomalies, hormonal abnormalities like thyroid abnormalities, progesterone insufficiency, diabetes,any infections, any uterine anomalies etc. The above causes can be ruled out by necessary investigations like thyroid profile, blood sugars, ultrasound etc. Also practicing of intercourse daily increase the conception chances. Avoidance of stress and anxiety regarding pregnancy are most important as they are also one of the causes of infertility. So relax. Hope this helps. Best regards..."

I have to do another blood test in Dec. 2014 and see the hepatologist in Jan 15. In the meanwhile I remember having a lot of itching on my jawline in December 2013 for which I went to a dermatologist. It subsided but has recurred now. I was researching on line and found a mention that elevated liver enzymes could cause severe itching which leaves dark marks (as is in my case). Could you throw some light on this. Also, how do I tell my PCP of my findings and ask her to look into this aspect of whatever it is that is causing elevated liver enzymes. I also have Type II diabetes.","Dear friend, Greeting s from Chat Doctor... As you know elevated liver enzymes well lot of causes...

It is on the right side, near the edge of the tongue. It sound not cause any pain. I have had a canker sore before but this is not like that. I have looked at geographic tongues but mine does not seem to have any outline, which seems characteristic of geographic tongues. I am 22 years old; weigh approx. 50kg; height is 164 cm. I do not suffer from any medical conditions. I have family history of diabetes and heart disease.","Hello and thank you for your question.  Any time you have a red lesion on the side of the tongue that persists longer than a few weeks it is important to have it evaluated in person by a dentist and possibly biopsied.  Oral cancer can occur at any age and is very common on the side of the tongue.  The tried and true method of identification is through biopsy.  Many lesions can appear flat, red and on the side of the tongue.  Highly unlikely that it is cancer at your age, but safe to rule out if it doesn't go away.  Geographical tongue does have a border but not always apparent.  It can also be lichen plans, trauma from an adjacent tooth, chemical burn from medication, new toothpaste, mouth rinse or spicy/citric foods.  I hope this helps you. Best wishes, good health. "
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have started taking lisinopril for high blood pressure two days ago. I was taking metropolol but I have diabetes and my doctor thought it was better. My heart rate seems to be up as high as 100 from my typical 70-80. Could this be caused by the lisinopril.,"Greetings. Welcome to Chat Doctor, and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Lisinopril is an angiontensinogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and is effective and safe in lowering the blood pressure, but no effects on heart rate whatsoever. Normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. This increase in heart rate you are experiencing is rather from discontinuing the metoprolol, which has heart rate-lowering features. If this is a worrisome happening to you and produces any symptoms, then you can discuss with your cardiologist about the possibility to put you on a Chat Doctor.  I hope I was helpful with my answer.

This is a tough question to be honest with you. Life expectancy is obviously dependent on crucial factors like general health. With heart condition, diabetes, and liver problems, life expectancy is greatly reduced. So the answer to your question is that probably less than the average (men in US/UK live till they are 80 years or so). The more important question is if there is any danger of dying in the short term. Gallstones won't kill you, so the answer to that is no, it does not oppose a danger. The problem is that gallstones can cause an infection, in that case they put in a little tube and Chat Doctor. In this case I would say that having Diabetes and being on the dialysis machine does not mean that there are just a few months or even very few years to live, with good medical care one can live quite a while like this. The heart condition, however, is more unpredictable. Over all, no danger of dying in the short term. Hope this helps."

There was no one to help Billy in any way. Since we had been friends in a small rural community for 64yrs. and there was no one to care for Billy, I told him I would help him as much as I could. When I first went to see Billy, there was a little 25yr. boy that the county had appointed to feed the dogs for Billy. He in the space of 6 weeks tricked Billy into signing over his farm to him. Billy really wanted the farm to go to his Mother s distant cousin s 3 daughters, who were just entering or finishing college.

Your doctor is right to some extent that diabetics are prone for fungal infection, but more commonly yeast infection. Moreover, diabetes as such causes an immunocompromised state which predisposes them to opportunistic infections like dermatophyte infection or ringworm infection. Dermatophytes usually spread by contact and is more common in areas where there is increased sweating. Symptoms of hiatus hernia are not related to diabetes nor ringworm infection. Increased pressure in the abdomen such as from obesity, coughing, or straining during bowel movements may play a role in causing hiatus hernia. I hope I have cleared your doubts. Thanks."

If your digestion power is good, take cows ghee and cows milk daily.4. Vegetables like pumpkin, snake gourd, ridge gourd are helpful. Add fruits in your diet.5.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi,Help! My wife had a stress test recently because her family doctor just purchased stress test equipment(note: she has had no symptoms of heart problems but has diabetes). She was the 4th person to have the test on this equipment. According to the results stress images reveal a large sized perfusion abnormality of moderate to severe intensity in the lateral and anterolateral walls . Stress images also showed a medium sized perfusion abnormality of mild to moderate intensity in the interoseptal and inferiolateral walls. Grade V stage. Gated SPECT revealed abnormal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 36%. There was severe hypokinesis in the inferior, lateral, anterolateral, and inferolateral walls of the left ventricle. There is diminished systolic wall thickening in these regions as well. Images would appear to show that heart is not functioning while under stress.Family doctor and specialist are recommending Standard Angiogram.Wife and I have doubts about the validity of the test because she was the 4th patient to have it(at least 1 other patient had an abnormal reading). Also there is a percentage of false positives in females.When we suggested a CTA doctors balked saying that she would still need a Standard Angiogram.Are we wrong in wanting the CTA first(we would pay entire cost of test) then if indicated have the Standard Angiogram.Thank you for reading and hopefully replying.","Hello thanks for posting here.  I have gone through the findings of the stress imaging. It is a very sensitive test for diagnosing coronary artery disease. By the reports of her stress imaging it appears she has multiple areas of blood supply insufficiency. It is a quite sensitive test and there is no reason to suspect report or images may not be accurate because it is new. Also, a faulty machine would not show so many deficiencies. So she definitely has significant coronary artery disease which is indicated by multiple areas of perfusion abnormality with decrease in contractile function to 36% and amnesia/hypokinesis. Should she undergo a conventional angiogram and not a CTA? CTA has more of a role in patients in whom diagnostic tests are negative, but the patient has heart related complaints. So basically it is to rule out coronary artery disease in patients who are less likely to have coronary artery disease. In her case, since there is a strong suspicion of coronary artery disease, conventional Anglo must be done. Also, CTA is not very good at quantifying the severity of a block. Also, even if she undergoes a CTA, and some blocks are diagnosed (which will come up in her case), the next step would be a conventional angiogram. So the ideal way to proceed from here is a conventional angiogram and definitely not a CTA. Wishing her good health. Regards"

Possibilities are- 1) he has persistent ureteric obstruction / reflux secondary to tuberculosis. Since he is diabetic, makes him prone to urinary tract infection. 2) he has bladder pathology secondary to tuberculosis or even longstanding diabetes. 3) his tuberculosis is resistant to treatment. What you need to do is to consult a urologist who can evaluate any urinary tract pathology, as well a physician who can evaluate his tuberculosis and diabetes."

Complete clearance of pneumonia usually takes up to 6 weeks.2. Yes, it is normal, especially with diabetes for infection to be persistent, and one lung will heal faster than another.3. Improved diet and deep breathing exercises with spirometer will be helpful. Later, need to get vaccination with Hemophilia influenza to avoid recurrent infection.4.

She is able to produce urine though, she recognizes family and friends, is aware of her surroundings but still extremely weak.

Her speech is barely there but she can communicate by  shaking her head and saying yes or no. I would just like to know if the fact that she can produce urine even though she still needs dialysis is a good sign that her kidneys would be fully functional again? also is she still supposed to be this weak given that she is able to eat her food?

That means that due to muscle weakness and lack of physical exercise it leads to swelling. The pain can be due to this as well. Can please check some signs of varicose veins? Like, change in skin color from hip till ankle joint. Swelling and pain can also be because of this. Please get it examined once if you notice it.

It is important to know the type of kidney disease you are suffering from. If hemoglobin is 6.9 then you have severe anemia, and it needs to be corrected. Blood urea 114 and serum creatinine 4.0 also needs attention. It is important to consult a nephrologist and then proceed with management.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Is microvascular leukoencephalopathy progressive? My mother had an MRI done in 2007 showing white matter disease, subcortical atrophy and small vessel disease. Over the past 6-7 years she had been falling in the house and I noticed after the falling she had been experiencing some forgetfulness. She has been to a neurologist about 5 years ago and he had given her a mini-mental state test, and sent her for neuropsych testing. She also suffers from renal insufficiency due to hypertension (she is in Stage 3). She was in stage 4 but a nephrologist has her in stage 3 due to the right medications. Her mother had died from uremic poisoning over 50 years ago (no dialysis then). Anyway, the neurologist based on his examinations and testing feels that she is in a mild to moderate stage of alzheimer. Her cardiologist told me that she has microvascular leukoencepahlopaty (she also has hardenining of the arteries). Her primary care physician feels that her dementia is microvascular (AKA vascular due to small vessel disease; she also has diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, cholesterol.) She was a smoker, but stopped about 17 years ago. She also has perepheral artery disease. She is on many medications including aricept and namenda. She also experiences parkinson-like tremors. She had a eeg showing a slows of speech language done about 4 years ago. Based on what I have told you is this dementia of a vascular origin, or is it a mixed dementia? She is currently 86 years old and resides in a nursing home. I know I witnessed while she was at home some forgetfulness like leaving a stove on, poor hygiene, moods swings (verbally and hitting). Also, she would have auditory & visual hallucinations (hearing music, talking to imaginary people). I thought at this point she would be better in a facility where she is exposed to people her age and mind stimulation would be more available than staying at home with a home health aide. She had a sister who had passed away last year at 83 years old from alzheimer. Could both sisters have the same thing? I know her sister had hypertension and atrial fib.","Hello, Microvascular leukoencephalopathy is usually progressive, as one ages changes to blood vessels usually add up. Apart from her age (in itself a risk factor), she has all other risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol changes etc., so while it is attempted to slow progression by controlling these factors it can't be stopped. As for whether she has Alzheimer's the forgetfulness and the hallucinations you describe are not common with vascular dementia, would go more in the favor of Alzheimer. However, neurological exam, imaging and neuropsychological testing are necessary for a more complete assessment. In addition to that one doesn't exclude the other, it is common to have mixed dementia due to both Alzheimer changes and small blood vessels ones, they are both the most common causes of dementia.

I do understand you concern. Your father has been with pneumonia and suffers from COPD and 10 % of his lung capacity is low.

If a person has uncontrolled blood glucose (hyperglycemia), then, a considerable amount of glucose is lost from the urine as kidneys are not able to reabsorb it. Persistent loss of blood glucose through urine does lead to weight loss as well as persistent weakness and tired feeling. Since she has chronic kidney disease, which also is a possible complication of diabetes only and hypertension which again contributes to kidney disease. In such situation it is very essential for her to achieve a greater level of glucose control. That will help in controlling kidney problem. Even for better outcome of the surgery strict glucose control is absolutely necessary. Off course during surgery and post -operative for a short period she will be on Insulin for better glucose control. But later again strict glucose control is a must. Thanks."

Gallbladder removed 2 weeks. Symptoms onset over the past 6-8 months. Rapid weight loss 110 lbs. Exhaustion, pain in back Need to rest after small trips to the store. Loss of voice with too much use. Recent loss of appetite (2 weeks)","Hello, You mention that your symptoms appear 6-8 months ago and in my opinion that is not related to your recently diagnosed Diabetes.  Metformin can cause a decrease of appetite, food consumption and induce weight loss, but I don't think that Metformin is the cause of your 110lbs weight loss. Metformin can lower the A1c by an average of 1.5% for 3-6 months therapy if it is well-combined with proper diet and physical activities. About your symptoms, if you were my patient, I will suggest doing some blood work like total blood count to check for anemia, basic metabolic panel to check the status of kidneys, electrolyte and acid/base balance, a thyroid panel to check for hypothyroidism and a spinal X-ray of your lumbosacral zone to see if there is any reason that causes your back pain. These test will give a lot of information and will be helpful to find an explanation for your actual symptoms.

Your sentiments are fine and understandable, but you also need to know whether he will sustain this kind of major surgery. He is quite aged and major surgery at his age carries more risk, apart from he must be having other medical conditions like hypertension and diabetes which has lead to this kidney failure.

It is the clinical data that is of paramount importance rather than MRI data. This MRI findings can be seen in patients with hypertension, diabetes also.  So we stress upon the disease that clinically evolves over a time. Further the symptoms that mark the onset of illness is very important in this neurological disorder.

I have been experencing severe burning in my mouth and vagina for over a year. I was told that it was probably due to hormones and have found nothing to relieve it. Recently, I started having burning sensation and pain in my abdomin. The pain is in the area of my belly  button and also seems to follow the course of my large intestine. I recently started seeing what appears to be pieces of tissue that pull apart just like tissue with red blood in my stool. Culture for parasites was negative, had abdominal and pelvic ultrasound and was diagnosed with ibs with mucus. I had colonoscopy 6months ago-normal. I also noticed a fishy vaginal smell and when cultured resulted in Strep B. I have been on antibiotics for a month with no improvement in symptoms or 3 culture results.

I can understand your concern. You actually have a basal-bolus injection regimen with 28 UI long acting insulin twice a day and 15 UI before each meal. This means that your total insulin doses is 101 UI/day. You need a large daily doses of insulin to control your diabetes, so in these circumstances it is not recommended to change the regimen of inline therapy and to start using Humalog 75/25.(You can discuss the problem of prescription coverage with your treating endocrinologist and find a way how to solve this problem.) Humalog Mix75/25 is a mixture of insulin bistro solution, a rapid-acting insulin and insulin bistro protamine suspension, an intermediate-acting blood glucose-lowering agent. This insulin is used with another insulin regimen(different from your actual insulin regimen) that in my opinion is not the right choice to control your diabetes, for the moment.

Random blood glucose value of 149 indicates that your blood sugar is in the Pre-diabetic range. You do not yet have diabetes, and if you control your blood glucose levels by appropriate diet and exercise, the chances of developing diabetes are reduced.

Many times he runs above 500 I hear. Well he has done meth tonight an has just done a reading an it is 565 an was gonna do his insulin (though his girlfriend suggests to hold off an do it at 7am instead of now @ 1am so to start doing it at the same time each day) but now w this high blood sugar reading what should we do ? He didn t wanna go to the E.R. an said it (his high reading) is probably cause he has recently just shot meth . So is he in need of the E.R.?,"Hello, Thanks for the query. It is clear that your friend has highly uncontrolled diabetes. Plus taking methamphetamine can further aggravate and cause severe hyperglycemia as you have now mentioned. This can also lead to a severe complication of diabetes called as diabetic ketoacidosis. Which can be a serious emergency condition needing hospitalization and blood glucose control to be achieved through IV Insulin and other supplements (electrolytes). At 565 mg it is essential that he goes to ER. Taking Insulin at home may still not correct the situation. If he wants to control his blood glucose effectively, event possible long term complications of diabetes then should refrain from methamphetamine. Otherwise, he will face more serious consequences. Ideally blood glucose should be maintained as : FBG <100 mg, PP 150 to 160 mg & HbA1c%<6.8. He is no where close to these recommended levels. It essential to convey these things to him. Thanks."

I appreciate your concerns. But, it is not common to get yeast infection on a single antibiotic course to treat UTI. It usually follows administration of multiple antibiotics simultaneously, that too for unusually long course. If you get it even on a single antibiotic course, definitely we have to look for any underlying cause for immunosuppression(like diabetes, HIV etc.). And, leaving an UTI untreated is not that good. It can lead to ascending infection leading to pyelonephritis, and may even affect our reproductive health. I usually give antibiotics like definite/norfloxacin(should not be pregnant) to my patients. Also, take plenty of fluids, and keep good oral and vaginal hygiene. I hope you will find this information useful. Thank you."

It is unlikely that the tingling sensation is related to stress. It is more likely that he might have simply stepped over his foot in an awkward angle that could have compressed one of the nerves supplying the foot. I don't think that's any cause if worried. But if this sensation persists, then he might need to get himself checked for the same for any chronic nerve compression, diabetes related neuropathy or any back pathology related root compression. So just watch out for persisting tingling sensation, any pain radiating down the sole of foot or weakness of foot and leg muscles. Otherwise, one episode once in a blue moon is nothing much to worry about."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am a 64-yo female with longstanding PMH of hypertension (28 years), well controlled on meds for the most part. I was diagnosed with diabetes in 11/2010, having been intermittently symptomatic for at least 3 years prior. Since DX, A1c levels have trended down from 7.0 to current level of 5.8, taking metformin and with dietary changes. Chronic depression/anxiety/stress of 20+ years is also adequately controlled with meds, but has been subject to ongoing unemployment woes since 11/2009 and consequential financial problems. Over the past 2 years I have noticed initially subtle, now gradually progressive mental status changes such as loss of focus and concentration, cognitive deficits affecting thinking, reasoning, decision-making and memory , plus mild expressive and receptive dysphasia signs. I asked my FP/PCP to order a brain scan w/wo contrast. The results I received last week are as follows: 1. Scattered nonspecific punctate bilateral frontal, bilateral parietal and left subinsular white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities may represent chronic microvascular ischemic changes, described in the impression as supratentorial and age-appropriate. 2. Bilateral old lentiform nuclei lacunar infarcts, the extent of which was not described. Having been a medical transcriptionist for 30+ years, I ve read a bit about both findings, and am vaguely familiar with the functions of these cerebral regions and the described processes, but I have two questions. I am assuming that either or both conditions are contributing to the mental status changes....particularly the bilateral lacunar infarcts. I originally thought these symptoms were attributable to chronic depression/anxiety/stress and the unemployment/financial problems. In your opinion, am I over-reacting to this news by making that assumption? Also, in view of these newly diagnosed deficits, would it be beneficial for me to consult with a neuropsychiatrist? I am asking because I am planning to seek counseling/ therapy for these problems since I need to re-enter the workforce. I am wondering if and how these conditions change the therapeutic approach. Specifically, I believe tests to evaluate the degree of cognitive deficits is in order, as it would stand to reason they would impact the modalities used in a therapeutic treatment plan. Any insight you can offer would be greatly appreciated.","Hello, I have noted all your complaints, imaging data. The imaging findings that you have can be seen in patients with high blood pressure and diabetes. The infarcts that you have described is also seen in patients with these problems. The most important thing to note is that whether you had any stroke in the past or not. People with high BP and diabetes can have these MRI changes without much problem also. So it is unwise to interpret this data without any clinical correlation. Regarding the cognitive problems as well as anxiety etc., this may represent a type of executive dysfunction which may/may not have relation with the current MRI findings. Interestingly some people can have both depression/anxiety and cognitive problem due to organic disease. Please undergo a joint evaluation by a neuropsychiatric, clinical neurologist as well as by a psychiatrist. Their clinical evaluation will tell us if you have any organic cognitive problem or not so that we can plan our treatment accordingly. Hope this helps"

Chronic kidney Disease (CKD) is the gradual loss of kidney function. Since how long is he on Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)? You should be taking to his NEphrologist so that he can examine him and suggest any rescheduling in PD. It is common for a CKD patient to have loss of appetite, not to worry. He will require few blood tests to see for the amount of wastes in his blood and also the hemoglobin level. If the test results show that the dialysis schedule is not removing enough wastes, your doctor may change the dialysis routine. This might involve changing the number of exchanges, increasing the amount of solution used for each exchange or using a dialysis solution with a higher concentration of dextrose. In addition to this, he should be eating right amount of food, low in sodium and phosphorus. Kindly consult a dietitian for this so that he/she can develop a diet plan suiting his weight, personal preferences, remaining kidney function and other medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My granddaughter who is 9 (Type 1 Diabetic) was recently admitted/discharged diagnosed with a kidney infection.  While ruling out appendicitius, they found evidence of an old legion (maybe from an enjury ? ) on her liver. Her liver emzymes were abnormal.  Yesterday me SIL went to the hospital and got results from a ultrasound.  They found that her spleen was enlarged, she has gallstones, some mention of sphreositosis (SP?) and her uterus is small. Diagnosis consistent with sicle cell anemia.  We do not know if her doctor is even aware of these reports yet.Could you please explain the meaning of the report?","Hi there, Im sorry your granddaughter is having some health issues. Let me explain each item in the report with the information you've provided me.  Phagocytosis are abnormal types of blood cells that are round instead of the usual disc shape. This can be quite common in patients with sickle cell anemia, as the body pushes out immature red blood cells due to the shortage of normal functioning blood cells. The spleen digests red blood cells that are normal, and in cases of sickle cell or other hematologic disease, can become enlarged due to the fact that it is working harder.  If your granddaughter is very anemic or having low platelets, sometimes a splenectomy (removal of the spleen is warranted). If she's not having any difficulty with anemia or bleeding, then leaving the spleen in is an option. When red blood cells get broken down at an increased rate, this can cause gallstones to form in the gallbladder, which can also cause liver enzymes to be elevated. I don't believe that her kidney infection or type 1 diabetes are related to her sickle cell anemia, but if she's having recurrent abdominal pain (sickle cell crisis) and gallstones, it may not be a bad idea to consider having her gallbladder and spleen removed at the same time. Finally, a small uterus is nothing to be concerned about in a 9-year-old. This sounds like an incidental finding.  I hope I have answered your questions. Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions."

Regarding side effects of Airport, it contains two Chat Doctor. Common side effects of albuterol are tremors, feeling of heart beats, rapid heart beats, etc. Beclomethasone is a corticosteroid in inhaled form. Although it is safe as it directly acts in lung.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","If there are any mental health doctors on this website, I would like to seek out your advice. My name is Amanda and I am 17, almost 18, years old. I m really worried about my mother, whose name is Sandra and is 55 years old. You see, when she was little, she was mentally abused by her mother for many years, and then when she grew up and got married, she was physically abused by her husband. It has been many years since then, but I fear she has become the product of psychologically abusive parenting. She constantly blames things on me and everybody else even if she is to blame, she regularly makes me feel bad about myself by doing, for example, things that require physical labor, and then complaining about it later that I did not help her due to whatever reason, which is usually because i was sleeping or doing homework. She makes me feel bad about myself in general, so much that i ve had to see councilors in the past due to depression. Of course, it wasn t just her that had made me feel sad, I must note. I know it s not her fault she s like this, but sometimes i can t help but getting aggravated and arguing back because I get so annoyed being blamed, accused, criticized, and put down all the time. However, the unfortunate thing is that i ve tried to get her help many times before in the past, but she always refused it and thinks that she is perfectly fine, when I see she is clearly not. But within this year and the next, I will be graduating and getting ready to go to university, so I do not want to leave her by herself in this state. I think she may be very mentally ill after all the years of trauma she s been through, so I came to this website as a last resort to try and help her. I ve tried to stop getting into arguments, i ve tried getting her professional help, and i ve tried just being there for her, but none of what i m doing seems to be making any sort of impact. I was wondering if this website could provide me with some answers on what to do, because I won t be able to always be there for her, and i m really worried. Thank you. *Side note: She has also had cancer twice, been diagnosed with diabetes, and has breathing problems which requires for her to take a puffer 4 times a day. She sometimes has spells in which she fixates on these problems and pities herself and is almost always negative. Please help me.","Degree understand your concerns went through your details. You are correct. Your mother is depressed and obsessive. The reason could just be as you points out. Early life mental trauma and her own experiences with family and problems with her body.

After a test the second evening during which he was anesthetized and his bile ducts examined and cleaned e was returned to his room pretty quickly. He seemed fine so we left (10:15 pm) When I returned at 7:45 th next morning, he had had a stroke and no one was aware. There was blood coming from one side of his mouth and he was wearing a diaper and was unresponsive. What happened?!?! I have gotten no answers.

We are not litigious people, but can t get answers regarding what happened the night we left him alone. Please provide insight and advise.","His have gone through your query & understand your concern. I think he needs to be evaluated clinically for the underlying cause of stroke which can be hypertension, diabetes, any vascular malformation, etc. But as this happened immediately after surgery, his gall bladder disease needs to be evaluated too whether it was just infection or is it something malignant. But stroke does not cause bleeding in vomits or sputum.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms seem to be related to peripheral neuropathy, probably caused by diabetes. For this reason, I would recommend performing a nerve conduction study to examine the nerves in your limbs. In fact the nerves are not in the head, but in the limbs. If the nerve conduction study results normal, the next step to follow would be a brain MRI to exclude brain small vessel disease, which is another common complication of uncontrolled diabetes.

He is insulin dependent diabetic and had high blood sugar before he drank it so he had a dose of insulin before he drank it. Is he going to be alright?,"Hello, Thanks for the question. Taking 80 ml of the said cough mixture gives a considerable amount of glucose, as the product contains liquid glucose for taste. So it is bound to give rise to his blood glucose. This will be a temporary rise. Other ingredients are unlikely to cause any serious problem. However, a person with diabetes should avoid taking cough mixtures which contain either syrupy base or liquid glucose. There are other preparations available free of sugar specifically for diabetics.

One of my brothers thinks he is lazy and that he should force himself esp when he hangs around all day smoking a cigar. He doesn t bathe often. How do I make him understand that he just can t do certain things at certain times? Thanks","Hi Madam have gone through your question and understand your concerns regarding your brother. As per the history provided by you, your brother is suffering from a disease which needs so much of personal care. Schizophrenia is a chronic disease where medications should be used regularly. Mostly, this disease cant be cured completely. With medication, we only suppress the symptoms of the disease similar to diabetes or hypertension. So, when medication stopped suddenly or taken irregularly, disease revert. So, my advice is to take medication regularly and in prescribed form as advised by the psychiatrist. Regarding course of illness in schizophrenia, we commonly talk about Chat Doctor.  In schizophrenic patients, they gradually deteriorate in all fields involving social, emotional, occupational functioning. So, gradually they don't study, don't participate in family interactions, lack judgmental capacity, stop going to job, soon...so, my final advise: 1)never discontinue medications.2)gather information and understand disease process in schizophrenia3) please understand that he's not pretending4) always be emphatic and caring towards schizophrenic patients in any time and in any situation.5)be ready to accept the truth that he will have problems with judgmental capacity, contact with reality and insights regarding his disease."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",My mother has been told she is 2 pints low on blood. Her heart is skipping beats in the bottom part of her heart. Now she has had a spell where she just blacked out. I m afraid she could have a stroke but the doctor said that a stroke comes from the top chamber of her heart. Is there still a chance of a stroke?,"Brief answer : Yes irregular heart beat may lead to stroke. Detailed Answer:Hello, Thank you for using Chat Doctor. The skipping beats from the bottom part of the heart, so-called premature ventricular complexes (PVC's), when happen frequently, are associated with risk of incident stroke even in patients free of hypertension and diabetes. Frequent PVC's are associated with impaired ventricular relaxation that leads to demodulation of the heart increasing the risk of clot formation and embolization. Even though there are not to many studies about the relationship of ventricular rhythm abnormalities with stroke, in contrast to the established association of atrial fibrillation(irregular heart beat by the upper part of the heart) with incident stroke. That's why your doctor told you that strokes comes from the top chambers of the heart. To rule out a possible stroke your mother should undergo a head CT scan or MRI. Hope this is helpful.

I am Chat Doctor Carlson. Lung infections are due to the infectious agents like bacteria, viruses and fungi. A few conditions favor lung infections amongst these are smoking, alcoholism, exposing yourself to cold, and underlying immune deficient conditions such as diabetes, HIV and other constitutive disorders. For your case, smoking favors the occurrence of a chest infect, and it can affect any lobe in your lungs though pulmonary tuberculosis has a predilection for the upper lung lobes. I would advise you to reduce and possibly stop smoking as this will expose to recurrent chest infections and possibly lung cancer. I will advise you visit a neurologist for proper follow up. Have a great time"

Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms do not seem to be related to any cardiac disorder. They could be related to a pinched nerve or musculoskeletal pain. Is the pain triggered by pressure in this region or arm movements? This would be another argument in favor of a musculoskeletal pain. In such case there is nothing to worry about. Otherwise, if the pain persists and is not modulated by touching or arm movements, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, "
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi there, was taken into hospital by ambulance with chest pain. I am 48 years old, didnt feel good all day. Woke with chest pain, which disappeared, later that evening chest pain became more severe. Arrival to hospital, after blood test my triponin level was 10 at 10am, then a further test was given at 1am and my triponin level went up to 1,500. My heart was tested with an angiogram, no damage was done. I then had a check to make sure i did not have a lung clot, all was negative. Why did i have such high triponin in my blood?","Troponin is a cardiac enzyme which is raised during heart attack and falls after heart attack. Probably your chest pain would have been relieved by medical treatment. As your angiogram does not reveal any block in the coronary arteries you might not be suffering from serious heart disease and that is why you were not subjected to angioplasty. However, you should be carefully followed for controlling the risk factor such as hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol etc. To avoid heart attack in the future."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My Kidney Specialist wants me to take a diuretic to help remove water and lower my blood pressure.  However, after Ive been on them for 3 days my feet began to burn and hurt. When I go off them my feet get better.  Is this a side effect or is it just me?","Hai, normally diuretics will excrete water from body along with electrolytes like potassium, sodium which are more essential for the maintaining body fluid system in a rhythmic condition. If any of the electrolytes level decrease or increase(pottassiumlevel) the fatigue and weakness will occur. Your burning feet and hurt will be because of this(variation in electrolytes) condition. Possibly in other conditions like diabetes, peripheral neuritis also will have your problem. But as per your quote when you with Chat Doctor.

I can understand your concern. I have gone through the x-ray report you have mentioned. This x-ray report is suggestive of bronchitis.

Better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only.

This disease usually has a hereditary origin, is rare, and its diagnosis is made by an iron panel; must have a transferring saturation> 45% and/or a ferritin level> 150 in men and> 200 in women, since these determinations can be altered in the presence of any hepatic involvement, alcohol consumption, infectious process, etc. If these analytical alterations were present, the next step would be the investigation of the genetic alterations in the HE gene whose alteration is the C282Y mutation. It mainly presents an involvement of the liver, pancreas, heart, pituitary. The main abnormalities that are to be found are alterations in hepatic chemistry, weakness, fatigue, diabetes mellitus, cutaneous hyperpigmentation, arthralgia, impotence, cardiac abnormalities. There is a triad characterized by hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and cutaneous hyperpigmentation that usually occurs but in late stages of the disease. There are measures to control the disease and prevent the progression of multiorgan damage, which is why an early diagnosis should be made."

Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. There has to be a source of infection to get persistent fever, and in your case, with the history you have narrated of evening rise of temperature specially with a known history of diabetes, the most likely source looks to be a urinary tract infection which could also give rise to both your lower back and abdominal pain. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to monitor your blood sugar level very closely, go for a urine routine/microscopic/culture and sensitivity test so that appropriate antibiotic could be instituted if need be, and possibly an ultrasound abdomen. I would also advise you for a fever profile like a CBC, ESR, Ty phi dot, and blood for MP, with a peripheral smear as well. The management in your case would depend on the results of a physical examination and reports of the related investigations. Till that you can go for an over the counter antipyretic like paracetamol, and an anti-spasmodic for the abdominal pain along with a diabetic diet.

However, its been a week now and I dont see improvement. I am worried. Please help and suggest which doc (specialist) i should consult for this issue. Regards Rajesh","Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is possible that you have higher than insulin levels circulating in your blood. This is causing the blood glucose levels to go below normal and that can cause problems like tiredness or dizziness. This if confirmed might be the opposite of diabetes where the insulin does not act on receptors. You should consult a doctor who deals with conditions of pancreas. They can be gastroenterologists or endocrinologists. They have to do certain tests to know the source of high insulin and few tests like insulin levels in blood and ultrasound and CT scan might be asked for. There are small tumors called insulinomas in the pancreas which secrete excess insulin and a search for such tumors is indicated. Insulin is a benign tumor of the pancreas in 90 percent of patients and removal of the tumor cures the patient of the symptoms. Please do not worry."

Recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (July 25, 2012) and took diabetes meds for a month with great results and meds were d/c d (oct 4) after a one month med vacation (from Tradjenta -sept 4).I have extensive food and medication allergies and intloerances. Food allergies include cayenne (muscle weakness), nectarines (anaphylaxis), black pepper (facial rash);oranges (itchy welts). Intolerances include milk, blueberries, cinnamon. Some foods cause itching with no rash (but require benadryl and last for about 8 hours--like tuna). Med allergies include biaxin, penicillin (rash), neurontin, lexapro,cardura- all of which make me itch; codeine (vomiting).

I cannot pinpoint the source of this itching.I recently had scratch tests for wheat, garlic and bell pepper--all negative.

Vomiting to codeine is an intolerance and unrelated to the food allergies. You could have urticaria and just like diabetes (autoimmune condition), you should get a complete blood count, TSH profile done with TPO antibodies to exclude a thyroid disorder. It quite often co-exists and a TSH alone is not sufficient to find this autoimmune hypothyroidism state.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",My dad is in the hospital for a pulmonary embolism. He is now getting accu checks and insulin coverage for blood sugar over 200. He has never been diagnosed with diabetes so why are they suddenly checking and giving him insulin. The highest it has been in three days is 227. Just not sure why he is being treated for that. Does it have to do with the heparin and Coumadin?,Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Pulmonary embolism is life-threatening condition. And in any such conditions or severe infection glucose levels tend to fluctuate a lot. So it is not recommended to use oral glucose lowering Chat Doctor.  So insulin is preferred.  Because action of insulin is immediate so better to control sugar spikes and avoid delayed hypoglycemia. And high sugar levels are not due to heparin or Coumadin. So no need to worry about this. No harm in insulin injection for high sugar levels.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",doctor said my body is making high blood sugar and has me taking 48mg of Fenofibrate and was told to not eat potatoes or noodles and that is all I was told the bottle is printed to take for my cholesterol I do not know nothing about all this and Im 45 yrs old,"Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. What your doctor is likely telling you is that you are pre-diabetic. If you were diabetic, your doctor would be prescribing diabetic medications for you. At this time he is advising you to change your eating habits and most likely he also advised you to exercise. It is called lifestyle changes. Weight loss achieved through diet and exercise can prevent pre-diabetics from becoming diabetics. As to Fenofibrate it is a medication for high lipids/cholesterol, which frequently is a condition present in patients who also have elevated sugar and are obese, and should be treated early to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases like having heart attack or a stroke. Your doctor likely has checked your blood tests - for diabetes he would check blood sugar level and so-called hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and for lipids/cholesterol he would have done a so-called Lipid panel which includes total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Next time you see your doctor ask him/her if he could show you/discuss these results. HbA1c of 6.5 or higher done on two occasions makes a diagnosis of Diabetes mellitus. HbA1c of 5.7 to 6.4 makes a diagnosis of pre-diabetes. Hope I answered your question. If you need additional information, I will be glad to clarify further. Regards and best of health."

Chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes are devastating because of the damage that they can do to kidneys and other organs.

They re waiting for the cultures to come back, but they seem very concerned. Could this be a sign of diabetes or leukemia or something that could be corrected surgically?","Hi, By large leukocytes I think you mean many leukocytes. If so, coupled with blood in her urine it probably means she has a urinary infection that can happen in a little girl. I am sure your doctor will be able to manage the infection with appropriate antibiotics when the report of culture comes. Only if required other tests may be conducted. Regarding Leukemia, I hope a routine blood examination was done which would have ruled it out. Similarly, for Diabetes a blood sugar if not already done will be done.

They then seem to suddenly become really itchy and swell up, becoming red, making it really painful to walk on my feet as it feels like these sections have become large, sore lumps. They seem to go away within a day or so. I have also had these symptoms on my palms. Currently there is an area of my palm like this that has spread to the inside of my wrist, which appears red and swollen and is quite tender. It feels like it is an internal thing, like there are toxins beneath the skin, as the skin feels really tight. I dont have any allergies that I know of. I dont know if any of this is related but I currently have a sore ulcer in my mouth and may have raised blood pressure (I did at my last doctors consultation), but apart from that I feel ok. Do you have any idea what this may be? Thanks","Welcome at Chat Doctor I have gone through your and being your physician I completely understand your health concerns. For how long you're suffering from it? Any other associated problem? Like diabetes ? Any fever? Any history of heart problems? Any liver problem? Any medications apart from hypertension ones?  Which medicine you're taking for hypertension right now? And for how long you're taking it? What is your BP reading?  Longstanding uncontrolled hypertension ultimately does cause damage to small arteries leading to antipathies which may give you these symptoms and it is also associated with naturopathies too, but again it should be diagnosed after careful evaluation by a physician.  Another probability is that you might be having some vasculitis which is giving you these symptoms. If I am your attending physician, I will go for FBC, ESR , LIPID PROFILE along with the DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF BOTH UPPER and LOWER LIMBS to rule out any arterial insufficiency.  If you are really concerned do meet your doctor, he may also get your X-ray of both hand and feet too.  Meanwhile stay calm and continue with your hypertension medications. You can use TAB NEUROSES daily along with tab AMELIA 25 mg at night. It will help you relieve symptoms. And do meet your doctor get well soon Hope your query is adequately ad Chat Doctor. "

After reading your question carefully I found that you have spells of dizziness usually in lying down position, every few months. It would have been more helpful if you had mentioned your age, if you have any other illness like BP, diabetes, arthritis or thyroid.

As per you history you are suffering from either vaginosis or yeast infection. In my opinion clotrimazole and clindamycin pessaries are good at treating such infections. You should get your blood glucose levels checked to rule out diabetes. To increase your immunity you should start multivitamin capsules single per day and increase your protein intake in diet (egg, pulses, milk; chicken, fish etc. are good sources of protein). Although these infections are common but the possibility of affecting your fertility after repeated infections; cannot be denied."

At about 9:30pm, I feel off to sleep. Sometime later, I awoke to severe pain throughout the back side of my body from my head to my ankles, my lower legs were hurting through and through, even my butt was in pain. I felt hot, sweaty, and I was confused as to why it was still dark and not daylight. I obviously had no sense of time, and I don t remember much after that other than I could not move I hurt so bad, and I was unable to get my phone to call for help. I obviously feel back to sleep only to awaken to the dark again, still in pain, now I am shaking profusely, my eyes can not focus and are twitching from side to side, and again not able to move. The next wake-up time, it was finally daylight, I was groggy, my eyes continued to move back and forth as before, not being able to focus, it was like my eyes were completely out of control, very tired, no energy, dehydrated, and barely moving. I do believe I had a fever. Later that morning, I was able to scoot myself up enough to reach my phone and call my daughter. She came over right away, but I was unable to get out of bed. I waited until Sunday to go to the ER. The only thing they could tell me was, my potassium was a little low, all other blood work seemed fine, I had a fever of 103.3, vomiting, diarrhea. Diagnosed with a viral infection and sent home. Since then, I have lost 12 lbs from basically not eating, I have kept as much Gatorade down as I can possibly take, and I have not felt right since.

Are you running a lot of lows and highs? Even if your blood sugar that you checked is normal (102 is a good value for a diabetic), that one snapshot in time doesn't represent what your diabetes is doing in a day. This sounds to me like it could be a different medical condition, a lifestyle issue, or a medication side effect. However, if you want to rule out if the diabetes is doing this, I suggest checking your blood sugars first thing when you wake up, before and after each meal, and before you go to bed. Do this for a week, and then show the values to your doctor. The response written above is a medical opinion, and does not substitute an evaluation by a medical professional.

I am 73 years old, weigh 190, and am 5 foot, 5 1/2 inches tall. I take medicine for high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, heart burn, high cholesterol and allergies (Diovan/HCT,Janumet,Tyenol for arthritis with Ultram, Lipitor, and Allegra).","Hi, Thanks for asking.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My dad (82) showed sudden temper flares, mood swings and aggressive behaviour. Psychiatrist prescribed oleanz rapitab 2.5 initially once a day. That did not change his behaviour. After 4 days he was taken to the doctor again. Dosage was increased to 5mg twice daily. Now after 5 more days of increased dosage, he is his usual calm and quiet self. How long should he take the medication? Will one month s treatment be enough? He doesn t have diabetes or hypertension. Will taking this drug increase the risk of diabetes or hypertension?","Hi, I read your query. Before I go on to answer, I would like to mention that I would have wanted to know if your father is suffering from any forgetfulness too. That would be important because in that case it would be important to treat him accordingly with some anti-dementia medication.  Currently, it would be difficult to say how long he would need olanzapine. It would be required to review him periodically and take a decision accordingly. Olanzapine doesn't increase the risk of hypertension although long term intake can lead to dyslipidemia and increased risk of diabetes. However, regular monitoring will help in taking care of that. Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes."

The symptoms that I have had leading up to this diagnosis, I have had as long as I can remember (since at least Jr. High). I am now 33 years old. I have felt slightly off today. I do have a glucose devise that I got for Christmas. I have not really used it as I was not informed by my doctor to do so. I decided to test, again because of how I am feeling.

A blood glucose level of 257 mg after food is a clear sign of having diabetes. The criteria to diagnose is FBG 126 mg and above, PP 200 mg and above and HbA1c% 6.5 and above. Therefore, you need to initiate treatment for diabetes forthwith. Do not delay. Many persons do not get any specific symptoms when diabetes develops. That is one of the reasons why it is unrecognized for quite some time. Along with starting treatment with oral antidiabetics (like Metformin + a Lipton), you will have to also adapt modified lifestyle, meaning taking restricted diet, avoiding sweets, junk foods, colas, pastries, bakery items, alcohol and even smoking. Plus exercise daily for at least 1 hour. My suggestion is pleased your personal physician or a ideologist and start the treatment. Take care.

I just want to know how musch time he ll take to recover? Please help.","Hi, Most would tell you that if it's been already several months since the stroke then, however, much he's improved to this point is probably the stable plateau upon which he will continue for the foreseeable future.  However, I've seen nontrivial improvements in stroke patients as far out as 18-24 months from when they had their event.  Of course, these folks were also aggressively and faithfully rehabilitating almost daily with either supervision or at home with the family, but they were actively working to make the affected functions better.  Therefore, the real answer is that it is highly dependent upon the amount and time a patient spends day to day rehabilitating and focusing on making functions better that were affected by the stroke.  Also, very important for anyone expecting good or full recovery is strict control of risk factors. Glycemic of 350-450 are significant risk factors for recurrent stroke and will also reduce his ability to rehabilitate if, in fact, that's what he's doing now.  Many good thoughts and hopes that your father can find a way to get his diabetes under better control so that he may be able to fully come back from his stroke. Hope I have answered your query.

I tried to sexual intercourse many times after marriage but I failed. Sometimes penis becomes loose during sexual intercourse and sometimes ejaculate just trying to intercourse. What is the reason? please tell me. I am very afraid and think why I got married?,"Degree understand your concerns went through your details. You are married for just two months. In the initial stages of marriage, Erectile Dysfunction and Premature ejaculation are normal. This happens due to sexual performance anxiety. Most of these problems will be cleared when the time passes and when you get experienced. Erectile dysfunction (ED) or impotence is sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis during sexual activity. The most important organic causes are cardiovascular disease and diabetes, neurological problems (for example, trauma), hormonal insufficiencies (hypogonadism) and Chat Doctor. Psychological impotence is where erection or penetration fails due to thoughts or feelings (psychological reasons) rather than physical impossibility. First you should rule out the physical angle of ED. Please consult a urologist for investigation.

My question is I want to have second baby and I dont want medication for diabetes , is it possible can I cure this waiting for ur reply?","Hello, as you've already noticed, body weight plays a very important role in blood glucose regulation. If you're overweight then loosing some Kilograms would help you reduce mean glucose values. Physical activity is a big part of diabetes treatment. It is as effective as a pill. You need to exercise daily for at least 30 minutes. You don't have to do intense exercise. Even walking a little faster than usual helps. Diet is very important as well. Avoiding food with high glycemic index and fat will help you achieve better glucose results. If you can't keep the blood sugar down to normal while being pregnant, you should receive treatment to avoid complications to the fetus. The most difficult time period comes after the 20th-24th week of pregnancy. Hormonal reasons make blood sugar regulation after that period more difficult than usual. I hope I've helped! If you'd like further information, please contact me again. Kind Regards!"

Ive always drank a lot of water, Im naturally just one of those people who drink a ton of water. But lately when I drink any water at all- even a small cup, my abdomen protrudes and looks extremely bloated and my bladder is immediately full. It takes little to nothing to fill it up- and this makes me need to urinate a lot more frequently. Ive had blood sugar problems when I was younger- Ive always been very active so I burn it all of pretty quick so I would sometimes get low blood sugar. Is there a possibility that I could have diabetes? My eyes have recently gotten worse in vision, Im always thirsty, my bladder fills up quickly and I have frequent urination. Sometimes I have numbness in my limbs- but I always chalked that up to poor circulation.","Hi, Thanks for your question. Noted your concern. These may be osmotic symptoms of diabetes. Due to high blood sugar levels body tries to flush out extra sugar through urine. Which leads to increased frequency of urination, abnormal thirst, generalized weakness. Due to change in osmolality of blood and sense fluid (because of high blood sugar levels) there is blurred vision. I may suggest getting following investigations done - Complete Blood Count-Blood sugar levels Fasting and postprandial, - HbA1c. - Lipid Profile - Renal Function Test including Urea, creatinine, electrolytes. - Liver Function Test including Bilirubin, liver enzymes. - Urine examination.

I will be seeing an oncologist in a couple weeks , I have had cancer before and radation but it did not advance any more.I look in the face very thin and my eyes look very weak , I do not feel well at all ,Could this weight loss and lumps mean there is a cancer in my body? thank you","Hi. Thanks for your query. Noted the history and understood your concerns.Losing weight for no obvious reason that the low magnesium but with history of cancer that got treated by Radiotherapy, although you have not mentioned the details of it can be due to recurrence of cancer. But there is no cancer that can have so many lumps in the legs and arms; these could have been lipomas that got visible due to loss of weight. The only sure-shot way is to get this ultrasound, FNAC and/or biopsy to confirm the cause of these lumps. Most important looks to be re-evaluation of the past cancer whether there is any recurrence and to get a confirmed diagnosis. Stress, anxiety and such mental conditions can cause the problems. Since you have mentioned that other tests are normal, we can take that you do not have diabetes, thyroid or liver related problems the cause of weight loss.

The symptoms went away and haven t come back. I did have surgery for a serious ear infection in July that (the ear infection) left the left side of my face paralyzed (hopefully temporary), my left ear deaf (again hopefully temporary) and dizziness (again hopefully temporary). I did go to the dizzy therapist on Thursday and did well that day. What happened to me?","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. 1. The extreme weakness of the right arm and leg could be due to a minor brain stroke-called as TIA (transient ischemic attack). In this condition, the weakness improves completely within 24 hours, mostly within 1 hour. However, there is a higher risk of stroke in the future, if not adequately treated. If you have any risk factors such as diabetes, high BP, and cholesterol, they should be treated. In addition, you may also require blood thinners such as aspirin. 2. Facial palsy, hearing loss and dizziness are related to ear infection, and they would improve over time. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. "

What can I do with diet or natural supplements to help clear my arteries and make the wall normal again.Thank you","**1. Prednisolone causes fluid retention and increases blood pressure, while most oral antibiotics do not raise blood pressure, which means that apart from alternate medicine, you should also seek consultation from your pulmonary doctor regarding the dosage of Prednisone and also the offending antibiotic .2.

I can understand your concern. I also feel that you are having acute exacerbation of asthma. Normal chest x-ray rules out pneumonia or lung cancer or other lung diseases.

PFT will tell you about severity of asthma and treatment is based on severity only. You may need long acting inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

I wake up with numb limbs throughout the night very frequently but have not been diagnosed diabetic, vein disorders nothing. I will drink more water but don t know if it would make it worse. I recently quit smoking after 15years, if that helps form an opinion. Thank you. Jeanie.","Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. As you have bulging of veins and also numbness of limbs a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. Post which we need to understand the blood sugar levels and also the venous insufficiency. You may be advised later to undergo a Doppler of veins to rule out any venous insufficiency, also and NCV test will help reveal the functions of the nerve. As with increase in the high blood sugar levels there might be deposition if sugar on the nerve and lead to numbing effect. As you were a smoker for 15 years and now have diabetes there might be a possibility of venous insufficiency. In either cases, physical therapy and some simple exercises symptoms will come under control and also on long run performing exercises will help you to control the sugar levels and also the numbness.

Have you suffering from diabetes or long-standing pain in lower limb? Dear your symptoms mostly my point of view suggestive of venous reflux. Hot and burning leg skin is often caused when leg veins do not properly circulate blood back towards the heart. Sometimes, leg veins fail and the blood that does not properly circulate to the heart often pools and remains in the leg. The excess blood in the failed veins then makes the veins swell, and the swollen veins can leak blood and fluid into the surrounding tissue of the leg. But you're also complaining of back pain possibly it may be due to back muscle spasm or lumbar spondylosis. Take physiotherapy and exercise may useful. Simple painkillers may also useful. You just examined joints of your leg and nerves conduction. What about the venous system or arterial system?? Please get examined color Doppler of lower limb and consult your general surgeon/vascular surgeon they will examine and treat you accordingly. Take care"

I am a 55 year old female with type 2 diabetes and a family history of cholesterol. Several statins were described to me before. I was on Aspavor for some time but I believe that gave me chest pain.

I can understand your concern. Fatigue, sweating, weakness can be symptoms of hypoglycemia. Hypoglicemia is more frequent in older diabetics with insulin. Shivering may be due to fever caused by infection. My advice is to do some fasting and random measurements of blood glucose with glucometer and to consult an endocrinologist because your mother may need to adjust the dose of insulin accordingly to glycemic results. I suggest doing the blood panel(especially white blood cells)to see if there is any infection that cause shivering and then to meet your GP for the right diagnose and treatment.

He has no use of his right arm and hand ( which is usually swollen) and drags his right leg and foot when walking. He is also a controlled diabetic. He is still not sure what he really has.","Hello! I read the question and understand your concern. A multiple sclerosis is very exceptional to be diagnosed at this age. I don't know the MRI pattern, but a stroke in a diabetic patient may be misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis in MRI because of lacuna strokes and periventricular post ischemic lesions. The difference may be done by a contrast enhancement which is consists with multiple sclerosis. The fact that the motor deficit is persistent is more consistent with stroke than multiple sclerosis. I would recommend a lumbar puncture with oligoclonal bands for diagnosis multiple sclerosis though not always it results positive.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Were I treating you, I would ask you following questions: Do you have cough that awakes you at night more than once a week? Do you have difficulty in performing routine activities (including exercise) due to asthma symptoms? Do you need to take Stalin more than twice a week? If any above answers are ""yes"", I would suggest you daily treatment like inhaler or montelukast. 2. For relief of symptoms, I would suggest you to use albuterol (Stalin) inhaler rather than Stalin syrup whenever you have symptoms. Please be sure that albuterol or levosalbutamol are ""reliever"" type of inhalers which are used on as-and-when-needed basis and inhaled corticosteroids (such as combinable) are ""preventer"" type of inhalers which are to be used daily and regularly as suggested by your doctor.3. In general, inhaler forms are chosen over oral tablet/syrup forms because inhalers work direct locally in lungs and start working quicker. Moreover, only a few portions from inhaled Chat Doctor.  Local side effects are more common.4. Common side effects of combinable are local - throat irritation, oral thrush, change in voice, and they can be minimized by rinsing the mouth after use of inhaler. As mentioned above, generalized side effects with inhalers are uncommon and can occur with long term use with high dosages. Generalized side effects of corticosteroids are gastritis, hypertension, diabetes, cataract, glaucoma, etc. and of formoterol (one of the components of combinable) are increased heart beats, tremors etc. But they are rarely seen with proper use. Hope above suggestions and information will be helpful to you. Should you have further queried, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health. Thank you & Regards."

This more commonly occurs: (1) When the virus has been recently acquired(2) If the immune system is impaired or not working well in some way(3) Fever or excess sun exposure(4) If there is another infection present. You should consider holding off any steroids because these reduce the immune system and may increase the frequency of outbreaks in some persons. If you recently got this infection then this is likely the reason for the frequent outbreaks, they should decrease with time. If this is not the case, then you should also be screened for diabetes, infection, HIV and, very rarely, any cancers that may be affecting your immune response.

Numbness to the chin and lower lip, as in your case, is attributable to many causes including bone infection, bone tumor/ cancer, trauma.

Your symptoms are compatible with a disorder called ""Palmer erythema"" in. This condition can be caused by various medical problems, each having its own range of severity. In a lot of patients, red palms have no identifiable cause, and they are presented under primary Palmer erythema. However, there are many cases in which the red palms are a symptom of another disease, being presented as secondary Palmer erythema. I would mention:-smoking and alcohol intake-high blood pressure-thyroid dysfunction-kidney or liver disorders-polycythemia vera-diabetes-rheumatological disorders, etc. I would recommend performing inflammation tests and thyroid hormone levels to exclude this possibility. Your renal function, may be related to it. But as, I mentioned before, in many cases, the cause can not be found even after a lot of tests. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes, "

Last May I began to notice that my left bicept was very sore for no reason. I don t recall exerting myself or over using it. I also noticed that my briefcase and luggage seems heavier than normal in both arms and I had to often switch hands. A few week later my right bicep was aching too especially when using it for every day lifting activities. My primary care doctor though it might be tendonitis and put me on an NSAID that did notthing. A few months later both forearms also have become very sore and painful when in use. I feel like I have become quite week in both arms having pain and weakness while doing things like raking leaves and using a screw driver. over the past few months my wrists and fingers in both hands have also become sore and weak.

A few months back he was also operated for hernia in abdomem. Now from about a month the fever n bodyache is back.","Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor forum I understand your concern for your father.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi I have pain and numbness in my feet and legs. Ihave had it for about 7 years now and I have been to about 10 doctors to tryand find out the problem but have had no diagnosis. I am 47 years old and other than that I am in perfect health and feel good . I have had all different blood tests, checked for diabetese .had nerve tests done , been to back doctors, and have had brain scans by a nuerologist and everthing came back negative. I am on tramedol now and have learned to live with the pain. Any suggestions.","Here I suggest when there is a pain and numbness in legs that could be a possibility of problem at your lower back or else the problem for your leg circulation. For this you need to check whether you have pain from your back to radiating at your leg level as well do you have the numbness from your back to your legs if yes then there might be a possibility of having problem at your lower back spinal or disc level. However the conformation can be done by MRI scan of your back and if that is positive then you need to visit an orthopedic for further guidelines. If no then there might be a chance of having less blood flow to your lower limbs this can also be possible because of high cholesterol so I suggest going ahead with Doppler test as well as cholesterol test. Here this test will let you know about the circulation in your lower limb and cholesterol will help you to know your cholesterol level in body as per the result I suggest visiting a vascular surgeon if Doppler test is positive. And a physician if cholesterol is more and start treatment as per the result. There could be also possibility of atherosclerosis for your lower limb blood vessels this will also be diagnosed With Doppler test if you want to check physically you can hold the calf muscle belly and try to squeeze it if there is a pain at your calf muscle with this squeezing pressure that means the test is positive however the confirmation will be done only by Doppler test. But due to this also there might be a possibility of leg pain.at home you can also use hot water and Deep your legs in that to have some more relaxing effect on your soft tissues as well as increase the circulation with the effect of heat.in any of above case, you can also visit a physiotherapist who can guide you for good lower limb exercise program which will help to increase circulation as well as relax the soft tissues. Take care."

It looks to me that majority of Doctors limit themselves by just prescribing medications disregarding the side effects. In the other hand How come the pharmaceuticals are not accountable and responsible form the damage on peoples health.,"Thank you for posting your query. Well the treatment largely depends on the blood glucose level. Often a borderline level or a mild increase in blood glucose can be kept in check by keeping away from sweets, restricting the calorie intake by a balanced diet and regular physical exercise which can be simple walking for about 30-40 minutes a day.

Since you are having high blood pressure and diabetes it is common to develop rupture of blood vessels[as there is high chance of aneurysm of blood vessel] .in your case there would have been an injury to infrapopliteal vessel resulting in the hematoma in the back of knee.

I have not other disease. I have just blood pressure.Thanks for answer YYYY@YYYY","Hello, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor, I am Chat Doctor. A blood pressure reading of 150/95 is borderline reading if persistent, you should be having lesser blood pressure, specially when on medication. There is no best medication for blood pressure, blood pressure medication is selected person to person, but ace inhibitors, diuretics and calcium channel blockers are most recommended around the world. A doctor considers many things like age, diabetes status, highest and lowest readings of blood pressure, and race etc. to select the best blood pressure medication for you. My advice for you is:1) First change your lifestyle.2) Use less salt and fat. 3) Stay physically active.4) Avoid Coffee caffeine, smoking (what ever is relevant).5) Lose weight if you are overweight.6) Monitor your blood pressure regularly if it stays consistently above 150/90 for a week instead of all the lifestyle modifications, do visit your doctor with that record to get the medication adjusted.

After taking glycomet after 10 days I got my periods and then soon after 17 days I again got my periods and this time a heavy flow. Please suggest whether it is safe to continue to take glycomet",Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your question. As far as glycogen is concern it does not cause menstrual problem. So no need to worry about continuing glycogen. As you have one child already then I would suggest histosalpingography HSG to rule out tubal blockage. And make sugar level in normal range also as diabetes is also a cause for infertility. Hope I answered your question. Would be happy to help you further. Take care.

Peripheral Neuropathy may show manifestations of Trigeminal neuralgia causing pain in areas supplied by trigeminal nerves as are your symptoms(pain in your jaws, cheeks, ears, etc.).  Get physically examined, get Nerve Conduction Tests & required Imaging tests done.  Sometimes STI (Facial herpes) may also show such symptoms because of the compromised immunity.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. As his hemoglobin is low, he will need blood transfusion.2. Similarly We pox injections are erythropoietin injections. It stimulates the bone marrow to produce more RBC and hence improved hemoglobin.3. Secondary to HIV, there is reduced immunity and this is possibly causing difficulty in treatment of tuberculosis. The CD4 count is low, indicating poor immunity.4. He will need good nutritional diet to improve immunity. At present, his major problem would be anemia, which will require blood transfusion and We pox injections. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."

The only thing that has changed is I started the Omnitrition diet 3 months ago and I have lost 60 pounds. There is 100mg of niacin in the product. I also take zolpidem, and birth control for menopause. Really worried about my liver!","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor Forum. Do not worry about liver. You have to modify lifestyle as liver is regenerating one before it get damaged sooner. Fatty liver is a reversible condition where large vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells via the process of stenosis. As the name suggests, it means the build-up of excess fat in the liver cells. It is mainly caused as a result of obesity. Fatty liver may cause no damage, but sometimes the excess fat leads to inflammation of the liver. An inflamed liver may become scarred and hardened over time. This condition, called cirrhosis, is serious and often leads to liver failure. In addition to losing weight gradually and safely(losing no more than one or two pounds a week), lowering triglycerides through diet or medications, diabetes control and eating healthy diet will help. I feel that you should get screened for Viral Hep B and C and autoimmune hepatitis also as both cause increased SGPT levels.  Continue taking Nutrition and Niacin as it does not injure liver function. A consultation from a gastroenterologist or a hepatologist will be helpful. Hope I Provided Useful Information. Take Care."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My husband has a mass on his right kidney.  The surgeon wants to remove the mass and a portion of the kidney using minimally invasive surgery.  He will not know until he is in surgery whether he will need to take the whole kidney and use regular surgerical procedures.  We received very little information about either type of surgery - pros, cons, concerns.  Im not even sure what to ask.  Can you direct me to more info.  How do I compare hospitals, doctors etc.  Thanks.","Hi, I can understand your concerns. The decision to remove partial vs whole of kidney depends on many factors like - size of mass, location of mass, function of both kidneys, fitness of patient and associated conditions like diabetes/hypertension which can affect the kidney function in the long run. Many of these factors are known before surgery from history, blood investigations and Computed Tomography (CT scan). The standard treatment for a mass less than 4 cm in size is partial removal. Partial removal can be safely performed up to 7 cm size (larger tumors can be removed based on location and function of opposite kidney). The idea behind partial removal is to preserve as much kidney function as possible since the remaining kidney in the same side will still continue to function. This is beneficial in the long run. However, partial removal needs more expertise and is associated with a slightly more risk of complications. There are scoring systems like RENAL nephropathy (www.nephrometry.com), which can predict the complexity of mass and thus guide the Urologist in making the decision. Though all these can give an idea about the choice of procedure, the decision for borderline masses may need to be taken in operation room only. The minimally invasive surgery can be either robotic or laparoscopic. While robotic surgery is a costly procedure, it is relatively easy to perform when compared to laparoscopic surgery. I can guide you further if you can provide the CT scan report, other investigations (Hemoglobin, serum creatinine, Liver function) and details of any medical condition of your husband. Wish your husband a safe surgery,"

I can understand your concern. This 2d echo report is not good for prognosis. It clearly says that his heart is not functioning properly. Pumping of heart is reduced. So fluid circulation in the body is also disturbed.

I can t explain how I felt. I just felt off. Not quite right. This lasted till about 1/2 this afternoon. I feel ok now.,"I'm sorry to hear about your ordeal. Tingling in the arms can come from multiple causes: cervical radiculopathy (pinched nerve in the neck), peripheral neuropathy (typically related to diabetes, AIDS, or alcoholism), or from peripheral nerve compression (sleeping in a strange position or on an extremity). In your case with the constellation of symptoms you felt it is likely you may have had a vasovagal reaction from using the washroom. This type of reaction can occur when you strain and increase the tone to a nerve called the legal nerve. Typically, this causes sweating, nausea, and an uneasy feeling like you described. I'm glad the symptoms dissipated and hopefully this will not occur again. If the symptoms do return it is best to see your physician for a thorough physical exam. I hope this answer helps."

Now TTC again, , 3 natural cycles no success, period length 25 to 35 days. Undergoing natural cycle follicular imaging. Today Cd 16 - right overies have 12 mm follicle and ET 5.2., bilateral PCO seen. When will I ovulate, are there chances of getting pregnant this cycle. Not on fertility medications this cycle.","Cellophane you for your query. On cycle day 16, the follicle size is not good enough. Even if we consider the longest length of your cycle, that is 35 days, then we can wait till a further 4 - 5 more days to see if the follicle reaches a mature size of 20 mm at least. If you do not ovulate, you would need fertility medications from your next cycle. Also, you need to have your POD under control, with weight reduction, lifestyle modification and Metformin to be added if your doctor agrees. Your tubal patency should be checked, as well as semen analysis of your husband. Your autoimmune disease is an obvious factor, but other reasons for stillbirth should be evaluated, such as Rh incompatibility, diabetes, hypertension, thalassemia, cord problems, chromosomal disorders etc. Take care"

You can take sublingual Nitroglycerin when you feel tightness in the chest after consultation with your treating doctor.

Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. She will need 24 hour holder monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation. Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. Ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Is there any stress or anxiety associated. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My blood sugar level is 141mg/dl, A1C= 5.8 Triglyceride = 219mg/dl , HDL =31 mg/dl .But a normal Cholesterol level. UA result protein is 30 mg/dl and some RBC and WBC 3 and 2 respectively. I have a normal PSA. I have frequent urinations also. So, I m worried about my health. Like Diabetics ? prostate problem, etc","Welcome to Chat Doctor, Perhaps I can give you some insight into the few labs you have given, but we don't look at labs without specificity and the entire lipid panel, not just one value and be able to give you an accurate impression of what they mean. In general, a fasting laboratory glucose test 125 mg/DL and above verified in the same manner twice is indicative of a diagnosis of diabetes. 5.7-6.4 A1C is prediabetic, but you have not mentioned whether these values are fasting or postprandial.  A fasting triglyceride level is an independent risk for heart disease and standards recommend keeping it below 150 mg/DL.  A level of 219 indicates a need for a low fat, high fiber, low fructose/high fructose corn syrup diet. So, I hear you are worried about your health. I do see some risk factors you can lower. A good public health diet is the Mediterranean Diet with no added sugar, no alcohol, and cut the fructose out, eat whole food and avoid added sugar. You would benefit from an exercise program to stimulate cardiac circulation. I would suggest both cardio and strength training routines. If you need to lose weight, losing it will be most helpful for lowering triglycerides, sugar and increasing overall health. Keep in touch periodically with your personal doctor to have your labs monitored and explained. You gave me a UA without a creatinine. However, I would keep my eye on the kidneys if you were my patient.  A UA of 30 protein could be significant, would like to check with creatinine ratio. Possibility of decreased kidney function. What is your glomerular filtration rate (GFR)? If you are in early stages of kidney decline keeping your protein lean and low might preserve the functioning you have. In summary, if you were my patient I would counsel you on a low fat, high fiber, high water, lean low protein diet with no added sugar and limited fructose. Read labels, no high fructose corn syrup. I would also advise a full physical and referral to a Dietitian witChatDoctorplete labs, diagnosis and diet order for an individualized lifestyle plan. You will feel much better for doing something about your concerns now than later. My best wishes for your continued health. Kathy J. Shatter, MS.RUN"

Because if there is something happening wrong you need to know what it is and take treatment in early stage, so you can cure it fast and come out of it early. Since you are diabetic with different joint arthritis as per your explanation, I also think so that there is a problem with nerves and blood vessels supplying to lower limb.

My sure levels are under good control with metformin and sliding scale on insulin. I have had several lows lately in the low 40s without changing anything. This is new and am not sure what to think about this.,"Hello there, I can understand your concern about this fatigue due to diabetes. Fatigue in diabetes can be due to various reasons. In your case like you have already observed low sugars, that seems to be the reason why you are having less physical strength and exhausted feeling. It seems that the insulin doses you are on are higher than what you require as Metformin by itself does not cause low sugars, usually. There could be another reason for sudden low sugars while being on the same dose and that could be deterioration in your kidney functions. So I would suggest get an FBS, After breakfast, Before lunch, After lunch, Before dinner and After dinner reading for a week (one reading each day with changing timings every day) and then get kidney functions test, HbA1c to find the cause of your sudden low sugars. If there is no definite cause then there is a simple need to change your insulin doses and try to avoid low sugars. Your fatigue will get better once sugars start to be in normal range. Depending on your age and other problems like heart diseases (if any) or kidney problem (if any) your sugar level targets can be decided. Do discuss these things with your planetologist who will make the necessary changes after seeing the reports. Till then try to eat frequent small meals so that you do not get low sugars. Hope this helps. Take care."

Does he smoke or is he exposed to air pollution/dusts/smoke? From your given history, I would like to make following suggestions for him:1. Were I treating him, I would suggest him regular montelukast. In addition to that, inhalers and nasal sprays can be decided after knowing his symptoms in detail.2. I would suggest him allergy testing which will help him to know the substances causing troubles to him and also to know how to avoid them. Based on the report, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe him allergen specific immunotherapy which may work on his immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms.3. I would also suggest him regular breathing exercises and avoidance of smokes/dusts/air pollution as much as possible.4. A healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc.) will also help him in a long run.5. Regarding side effects of cortisone, it is a corticosteroid. So prolonged, repeated use can cause many side effects like gastritis, hypertension, diabetes, weight gain, cataract, glaucoma, etc. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to him. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish your friend the best of the health. Thank you & Regards."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","On sat night after brushing my teeth , I noticed my lower gums started to bleed . Since then, they have continued to bleed with brushing. The underneath part of my tongue feels very painful, like a burning sensation as well as the tip of my tongue. After brushing this morning, one tooth on each side...towards the back look as if I brushed off part of the gum! I was on antibiotics for 5 weeks due to a severe dog bite, but have been off of them for 3 weeks now. I have an appt tomorrow with a periodontist, but am seeking some type of clarification since my mouth has been hurting for 5 days now with no relief :0( I should also add that its been several years since I ve been to a dentist , due to extreme fear, high anxiety and I even fainted once walking into a dentist office. But at this point, it s a necessity to go. Thank you!","Hi. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor forum, I have read your concern. As you c/o bleeding while brushing teeth, your gums may be highly inflamed, ie, gingivitis. The gum infection may be due to-Plaque and food debris accumulation as a result of poor oral hygiene maintenance. Systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, hypertension,epilepsy, autoimmune diseases. Improper brushing techniques.First I want to tell you that please do not be panic regarding dental treatments. If your dentist is doing any procedure, which will be painful, then surely he/she will administer local anesthetic solution. Meanwhile, brush your teeth twice daily in proper manner. Get your teeth cleaned by your dentist. Include plenty of nutritious rich food into your diet. Bleeding from gums will stop, once the plaque underneath the gums are removed and gums become intact, firm again. HOPE THIS HELPS.TAKE CARE."

If there is local infection at the site of surgery, go for testing of pus for culture and sensitivity test.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","my mother is had diabetes before 10yrs and  now before 1yr she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis.before some days she was complaining of some gastric problems,the doctor said her to go for an ultrasound,the reports revealed that she had a stone in the gallbladder and the liver was also enlarged.what should she do now.","Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. In most cases, treatment of gallstones is considered necessary only if you are having symptoms. Of the various conventional treatments that are available, surgical removal of the gallbladder is the most widely used. Some alternative treatments have also been found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of troublesome gallstones. When deciding what course of action to take for symptomatic gallstones, doctors usually choose from among three main treatment options: Watchful waiting, nonsurgical therapy, and surgical removal of the gallbladder. Though a gallstone episode can be extremely painful or frightening, almost a third to half of all people who experience an attack never have a recurrence. In some cases, the stone dissolves or becomes dislodged and thereby resumes its ""silence."" Because the problem may solve itself without intervention, many doctors take a wait-and-see approach following the initial episode. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health."

Considering your age diabetes is unlikely still my advice to you is that you must undergo blood sugar level testing once. This is very much important (as occasionally diabetes may occur in young people)You should also receive proper antibiotic course such as Amoxicillin+ dicloxaciiline to cover both gram +ve & -Ve organisms. So it is advisable to have proper dermatological consultation. Improve your hygiene & get your BSL report done which can help you relive from this problem permanently."

Following the herpes infection the virus will reside in the ganglion. Whenever there is s triggering factors like other bacterial infection, dust, diabetes medicines or malnutrition which decreases the body immunity, the herpes virus gets activated and produces its symptoms. This could be due to staph infection which you had and which as stimulated the dormant herpes infection and produced these symptoms. Because of frequent infection you are having this features of depression. Once your symptoms comes down you will be alright. You need to boost up your immunity by having good nutritious food and vitamin A and E. Thank you."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am going to run this by you to see if you have any suggestions. My brother is a family physician and either he doesnt believe my mom or he just doesnt know what is causing this. She has also seen a gastroenterologist and her colonoscopy found slight diverticulitis and 2 non cancerous polyps that were removed and no problems found with the endoscopy other than she had a slight inflammation at the top of her stomach that the physician didnt seem too worried about. This is her symptoms... She complains of a severe tightness around her rib cage to the point where she has to take off her bra and has trouble breathing. She also gets bloated sometimes when this happens. I cant stand to see her in pain like this anymore. I did a search on the Internet, (yes, I know you guys hate armchair doctors.. Lol) and it seems a lot of people complain about this but have no answers. A bit on her background- she is 80 years old. Shes a diabetic. We thought the metforman was causing the pain so they put her on lantus and humalog. I know diabetes can cause peripheral nerve damage, not sure if that can cause the tightening. She also has had her left kidney removed because the artery that carried the blood to it got clogged and it failed, so they removed it 12 years ago. She also had two stints put in her left and right illiacs to open them as well. She recently had an MRA, and they found two of the 3 main arteries to the bowels are become blocked, but the physician didnt seem to think this would cause tightening, but chronic diarrhea, which she does not have. This all started after she had the flu last January. She has not visited any foreign country recently, so I dont think its a parasite. I read that maybe she should have a stool sample to check for parasites. Have you heard of this condition? Any of you? Any suggestions on what to try? I am at my wits end. She lays in her bed and moans when this happens and shes not a complainer so I know its bad. Thanks for your time.","The picture that you have portrayed seems to be more in favor of a heart related problem than anything else. It is not explained by any of the problems that you have cited, namely, polyps in the colon, diverticulitis. She has a history of blockage in various arteries-kidney, small bowel, Iliads. So she probably has a tendency to excessive clotting. She may have had blockage in one of the arteries supplying the heart and suffered from a mild heart attack. In diabetics, the symptoms of a heart attack are suppressed and atypical. So, I would suggest that you immediately show her to a cardiologist"

There is moderate supraspinatus tendinopathy & a very small bursal surface anterior supraspinatus tendon tear immediately adjacent to the biceps interval, 9 x 5 x 3mm & mild thickening of the subacromial bursa, 2.2mm on abduction.

I have obtained no pain relief & becoming very frustrated at the lack of use of the shoulder & the extreme pain caused by some (normal) movements. I ride a road bike (upright - not racing) to & from work daily & doing it gently, to minimise bumps to the shoulder. If the anti inflammatory drugs are not working, is it because there is no inflammation but there is another problem. Could it be pinched nerve & if so, how is it corrected. I m seeing an Osteo who is massaging the muscles around the area & avoiding the shoulder itself. I welcome any ideas on what the problem may be & the appropriate course of action. thanks Peter","Thanks for the information. Depending on time since injury initial immobilization in a broad arm sling for 2-3 weeks is necessary to heal minor tears, bursitis,afterwards active shoulder exercises are begun very gently intermittently along-with oral anti-inflammatory for the period of pain. Gradually sling is discarded for longer periods of time intermittently. The process may take as long as 6 weeks to heal completely. After six weeks normal shoulder activity and muscle building exercises are indicated to bring back strength of shoulder.Also, any diabetes should be ruled out with blood and urine tests think it should heal with this regime"

Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms seem to be caused by possible neuropathy or a metabolic disorder (electrolyte imbalance, thyroid hormone imbalance, etc.). A cervical intervertebral disc bulging, causing compression of the nerve roots, can not be excluded either.

Could you please let me know is the back pain due to pancreatitis as all his reports are clear and recently he under went pancreatitis cancer blood test too but reports were normal so what could be the reason of his constant back pain.","Hello. Pancreatitis itself is a cause of back pain and abdominal pain. Pseudocyst with secondary infection can also cause the same. If acute pancreatitis progresses to chronic stage, obstruction of the pancreatic duct can lead to pain. Since pancreas is the source of insulin, patients with chronic pancreatitis can have diabetes. High cholesterol (triglycerides) itself is a cause of pancreatitis. Pain due to acute pancreatitis is usually severe and is associated with omitting.

Morning of day 2, my wake up reading is 192. Worried that I can t lower my sugar levels down enough.","Hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea antidiabetic medicine. It works by causing the pancreas to release insulin, which helps to lower blood sugar. I can see that your diabetes numbers with 2 mg Glimepiride are not OK. You have high fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels and this means that Glimepiride is not effective. If you take the medication regularly, have a proper diabetes diet and do regular exercise every day this means that the treatment with Glimepiride is not the right choice for you,At this moment. If you were my patient I will recommend you to continue with this regimen of therapy(glimepiride 2 mg/morning +diet + exercise) for a couple of days, because you just start it yesterday, and it is too early to achieve the best results. If after some days with this therapy you have the same sugar levels, then I suggest consulting your treating endocrinologist because it is necessary to add another diabetes Chat Doctor. You should learn how to live with diabetes. This is very important for you. My advice is talk to your health care team and learn how to take care of your diabetes. Follow the diet and exercise program given to you by your health care provider. These are elements to manage your diabetes. Hope this information is helpful. If you have other doubts, feel free and ask. Best regards. Glimepiride should be taken by mouth with breakfast or the first main meal of the day."

Did I get Diabetes? is there any risk to fetus?","Hi there,Please do not worry it does not seem like you have diabetes with the values that you are showing. . Your Body mass index based on the values you have given is in the normal range putting you at a lower risk for diabetes. Diabetes is more common in pregnancy in women who have had a family history of diabetes, diabetes in a previous pregnancy, history of polycystic ovaries, or if overweight, if you do not have any of the above factors you are at a lower risk for it. Diabetes can affect both the mother and the baby in pregnancy. It can cause excess weight gain of the baby making delivery difficult to achieve and more likely of a Cesarean.Also, certain complications such as bleeding after delivery and chances of Admission to NICU of the baby increases. The baby needs to be monitored in the first few hours after birth for sugar levels and other complications, some may have breathing difficulties. But all these complications can be minimized by checking sugar levels regularly in the mother who is diagnosed to be diabetic in pregnancy, she may also be given insulin to control the sugars. So just repeat the glucose tolerance test at 26 weeks and if its normal do not worry. Hope this helps. Regards."

Please type your query here...my girlfriend has type 1 diabetes she just took her blood pressure and it was 192 over 160 she has been type 1 for 20 years and is 38 years old under alot of stress how severe is this reading and how concerned should i be?","Hello, Regarding your concern, I would explain that a single high blood pressure value does not indicate uncontrolled high blood pressure. It could be related to anxiety or physical activity. Coming to this point, I would recommend you to closely monitor her blood pressure values, frequently during the day, in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax and write those values down. If her blood pressure values are persistently high, I would recommend consulting with her doctor for a physical exam and some blood lab tests to investigate for secondary causes of high blood pressure. In such case antihypertensive therapy may be needed. You should know that uncontrolled long-term (chronic) hypertension is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, which means that it leads to an increased risk for stroke or heart attack.

Confirm diagnosis with help of urine routine and urine culture test to see if any pus cells are there and any what antibiotic is going to be effective in your case. Presence of diabetes, blockage to flow of urine are other factors which need to be ruled out. As far as your question whether infection has gone to the kidneys (pyelonephritis).

I ve never seen it this high. I have an appointment with my internist in 2 weeks, but I m worried about the risk of stroke or heart attack. I take Vytorin for cholesterol, baby aspirin daily and levothyroxine for Hashimoto s thyroiditis. Is there something I should be doing now?","Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that these high blood pressure values could be related to different causes: 1- thyroid hormone imbalance. As you are taking levothyroxine, it would be necessary check your thyroid hormone levels to regulate the dose of levothyroxine.2- Other secondary causes of high blood pressure should be excluded. That is why I would recommend performing some other blood tests : - complete blood count for anemia-liver and kidney function tests for possible dysfunction- fasting glucose for diabetes-blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate). 3- If all the above-mentioned tests result normal, primary hypertension should be taken into consideration. In such case, you should discuss with your doctor on the possibility of starting antihypertensive therapy. Meanwhile, I would recommend some tips to help maintain a normal blood pressure: - reduce salt and caffeine intake-perform a lot of physical activity (walking, aerobics, recreational sports)- try to lose some weight if you are overweight.

Once had to call 911 due to her inability to breath. Suggestions, recommendations, or any pre-pre diagnosis thoughts?","Severe compression between sternum and throat, and vomiting contents from throat, not her stomach may suggest some esophageal motility disorder (either primary or secondary).

Nonspecific esophageal motility disorder (inefficient esophageal motility disorder)4.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I had routine lab work done in nov and my troponin level was 6.1.  A week ago I had lab work again and the level was 9.5.  I have a Thallium stress test scheduled for the end of the week.  Needless to say I am quiet anxious about the test.  I have not had chest pains.,"Hello, Brief answer: Troponin level may vary according to acute heart insult also from lab to lab. Sometimes false positive troponin present. Explanation: My opinion is that troponin level is used to diagnose acute coronary syn Chat Doctor.  Chest pain and dynamic or ischemic changes in EGC are an indication to measure troponin. So, it is not any time investigation such as CBC. Positive troponin points to myocardial injury, so anti-ischemic measurements should be initiated. Sometimes false positive troponin presents with renal failure for example. Also, variation in lab results may be an error in lab procedures. In your case, having no past history of chest pain makes diagnosis of ischemic heart is far-fetched. I suggest my patients the following if positive troponin. Do an EGC, echocardiogram and if those suggest myocardial ischemia, anti-ischemic measures are initiated on spot. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about other risk factors to develop ischemic heart disease, smoking, obesity, family history, etc. Also ask about diabetes as in diabetics silent ischemia happens (that means without chest pain). Conclusion: I suggest you do your thallium study as soon as possible to see if any ischemia develops in your heart and so treat accordingly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","It has been approximately 3 months since I had all my remaining teeth extracted. I have been dealing with the usual bone working out of the gums and pain trying to get used to the new dentures but I have also been dealing with dizziness , nausea, lightheadedness , generally cant function, kind of a euphoria type feeling. There was a bout with infection in the gums where there were puss pockets but that has subsided now after a couple doses of antibiotics. Could the teeth being extracted cause this? could the infection have affected my brain. Also I suffer from MS but I have been seeing a nuerologist and everything seems to be ok. I have had 2 MRI s done in the past month and a half. Thanks","Hello & welcome, First & most important thing here is, just go for check up of your newly made Denture. This is so because, denture if over extended on palatal side, causes feeling of nausea thereby leading to dizziness. Although this nausea & dizziness can be due to gastric irritation by the antibiotics taken by you, checking denture for over extension will be primary advise. And if denture is found overextended, then can be treated by grinding & reducing extension of the denture to proper limits by your dentist. Absolutely, oral infection & brain has nothing to do with each others. Tooth extraction can cause pain but not nausea. You should not wear your denture if there is any residual infection in extraction socket which should be treated immediately. You can undergo blood sugar examination as diabetes patients suffer from delayed wound healing & difficulty in wearing denture. Take care."

I am presently suffering from right shoulder pain that sometimes the pain goes down through my hand.  I find difficulty in rotating my arms due to the pain in my shoulder.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I am experiencing a very stiff right index finger middle knuckle. It feels like it gets stuck in either straight or bent mode. When I try to either straighten or to bend it feels like it gets stuck and the two parts of the knuckle are rubbing against each other. When it finally moves it is very uncomfortable.,"Trigger finger. Tendon usually glides easily through the tissue that covers it (called a sheath) because of a lubricating membrane surrounding the joint called the synovial. Sometimes a tendon may become inflamed and swollen. When this happens, bending the finger can pull the inflamed tendon through a narrowed tendon sheath, making it snap or pop and it some feels like locking. This can be caused by a repeated movement or forceful use of finger. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and diabetes also can cause trigger finger. So can grasp something, such as a power tool, with a firm grip for a long time."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have recently had a filling replaced by my dentist, I have type 2 diabetes and I am a 44 year old male, after the dentist all was OK, now 2 days on rash of red spots has appeared on my face. I very rarely get spots and I am wondering if  it could be related to the dental work. In addition if I put after shave on my face the area feels numb.","Hello, A rash reaction on your face would be a possibility. Is your rash around your mouth or limited to the side where you're filling was done?  Do you notice any reaction inside your mouth? This could indicate a sensitivity to a material used at the dental office. Does your dentist office wear latex gloves? A rash on the face is a common reaction for latex sensitivity. Most dental offices limit the use of latex. Nitrite gloves or vinyl can be worn. Latex sensitivity should be noted on your medical history if you find this to be the cause. An allergist could confirm the sensitivity. A medical history with controlled diabetes raises some concerns with dental treatment. Surgical procedures may be at risk for delayed healing, but restorations and fillings, commonly, are not of major concern with diabetes. Uncontrolled diabetes can show stress on the tissues of your mouth and compromised overall oral health that would require greater attention. You may tend to have a greater amount of inflammation with your gums and tend to not respond as quickly to gum treatment therapies. I recommend discussing and describing your condition with your dentist to decide if you require further evaluation. Some trauma to the soft tissue of the face may be experienced during dental treatment and cause redness that should disappear fairly quickly. A true rash, Indicating an allergic reaction, should be investigated further. Additional exposures may elicit responses with increased severity and risk of anaphylaxis. Should your symptoms increase, consider a visit to your physician. This may not be related to your dental care and just a coincidence. I hope my suggestions are useful to assist in your diagnosis. Thank you for your inquiry. I would be glad to answer additional questions if you can provide me additional details concerning this rash."

Ideally urine sample should be sent for culture- sensitivity and colony count, before initiating treatment. As soon as the result of sensitivity test is available, treatment is started [or changed, if already started] according to maximum sensitivity.2. Since you don't have health insurance, even then predisposing factors to infection like: obstruction, calculus, diabetes should be properly identified and managed/treated [for which opinion of urologist is necessary since he may distinguish lower tract infection from upper urinary tract infection]3. Take plenty of water and fluids. Avoid: hot/spicy foods, salt, garlic,mustard oil, citrus fruits, alcohol,excess physical exertion.

We plan and program our workout session in a fashion where the work out behind reducing the swelling by exercises and improving the cardio endurance along with improved metabolism.

My blood sugar control has been good,using humalog (short-acting insulin) and Lants (insulin for basal blood sugar contro),but I was in an auto accident 8 years ago. I had chronic fatigue just weeks after the accident. Many tests were done, but nothing significant was found. i have had high liver enzymes since the accident, but a biopsy showed no disease. Doctors said, Just live with it. This year i went to an osteopath, who immediately noticed my liver was congested and had structural damage. Even though my hemoglobin A1C tests have been in the mid 6 s, when i get low, my blood sugar will sometimes spike after just 5-10 grams of carbohydrates. other times I m still low after 25 grams of carbohydrates. This happens 1-2 times a week, with no triggers I can anticipate. In talking with a diabetes educator, I learned that this was probably a function of my liver being off. Is there any way I can anticipate how my liver will release sugar, or is it simply a guess and check process? I went to a new endocrinologist last week. When she looked over my labs, she said I should be referred to a liver specialist. Since my A1C levels are good, and I check blood sugars regularly, eat regularly, and do everything according o good diabetes control, she say the only variable is my liver function.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",My mother had a severe stroke about 3 months ago.  She can not speak or use the right side of her body.  She is a diabetic.  She has made some minor improvements during her recovery but has leveled off and even regressed in the last 1-2 weeks.  She has been really lethargic over the last week.  She wants to sleep all of the time.  Her glucose level the last several days has been in the upper 300s several times over the last few days.  Could this high glucose level be responsible for her lethargy?  We are not sure what her glucose levels were before.,"Hi, Thank you for asking your query on Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and to give a direct answer, both high and low levels of glucose in a diabetic person can cause fatigue. High sugar levels in the blood slow down the circulation thereby decreasing the oxygen/nutrient supply to the tissues. Low blood sugar levels lead to decrease supply of fuel (glucose) to the tissue cells and hence can lead to fatigue. This means the blood glucose levels in a diabetic should be monitored and maintained at normal levels with the help of medications and lifestyle changes, at all times. Apart from diabetes, there are other causes of fatigue like anemia, low thyroid levels, infections, medicine side effects etc. and need to be taken into consideration too. Kindly consult your doctor for the further course of action and let me know in case of any further query. Best Chat Doctor. "
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I m 58 yo female. 5 9 181 lbs African American with family hx of diabetes. My fasting glucose was 129 although I was not fasting and my doctor told me to go ahead and take the test anyway. So the results are more accurate as an after meal result. I did a true fasting test today and I await the result. Should I be concerned. My Dr said I m pre-diabetic.,"Hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) measures blood glucose after you have not eaten for at least 8 hours. It is the first test done to check for prediabetes and diabetes. If you were not fasting, then the result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis of pre-diabetes or diabetes. In my opinion, This result can be considerate like a random blood sugar (RBS) and measures blood glucose regardless of when you last ate. Random testing is useful because glucose levels in healthy people do not vary widely throughout the day and Blood glucose levels that vary widely may mean a problem. This test is also called a casual blood glucose test. It is true that your age, positive family history and being African American are RISC factors for Diabetes. But the test result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis because it is not fasting. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/DL is considered prediabetes. If its 126 mg/DL or higher or a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/DL or higher ; on two separate tests, you have diabetes.(Actually, if you were fasting, 129 mg/DL can be suggestive of diabetes not prediabetes and the next step will be to repeat the test for the confirmation of the diagnosis)In my opinion you don't have reason to be concerned because the test result is not a fasting but a random measurement, and we can not reach the diagnosis only with this test. So, be patient because the true fasting test will give the exact information about your situation. Hope this is helpful. If you have other debts, feel free and ask. Best regards."

Last week she had a silent heart attack and she also has type 2 diabetes. Is this normal and how serious is her situation.  She is 76,"HelloThanks for posting at Chat Doctor. Your mother-in-law had a silent heart attack which is very typical in diabetics. Stents are put to reopen and establish flow in the arteries of the heart which are blocked. Due to the silent heart attack that she had, the heart pumping function seems to have suffered. Hence, it is not able to effectively pump all the blood it receives leading to fluid overload. This excessive fluid tends to accumulate in the lungs. This causes breathing difficulty. This condition is known as pulmonary edema. I suppose your mother-in-law is suffering from pulmonary edema. It requires treatment with diuretics (water pill), nitrates along with other medications for the stent and the heart which she is already on. Once the extra fluid resolves, she will get better. The Left ventricular ejection fraction or the pumping function is normally 55-60%. After a heart attack, it Chat Doctor.

The other possibility is that because of the aneurysm surgery itself there maybe been a bit of a bleed perioperative (during the procedure) or a bit postoperatively (after the surgery) and the expanding lesion or increasing pressure inside the head is causing the nausea/vomiting.

I suspect there was a large stone causing obstruction and HY Chat Doctor.  Subsequent percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) treatment was done to treat the stone. The serum creatinine level goes up due to urinary obstruction, probably the right kidney stone in your mother. Since the obstruction was present for some time in the past, the kidney function might have got affected. As per medical literature, a kidney stone causing obstruction for more than 10 days can cause obstructive myopathy which is form of permanent damage leading to the kidney being unable to function properly. The raised creatinine is a consequence of this obstruction and a level of 1.4 is borderline high. It is most likely that the kidney was not much affected by the duration of obstruction by the stone.

It starts in my hand then travels up to my face, and in my foot traveling up my leg. It is almost like they have fallen asleep but it lasts for hours -days. My foot has actually been like this non-stop since late december. The first time it happened I was admitted to the hospital on suspection of a demyelination disorder. After several tests (mri,ct,blood) I was sent home. Nothing was determined and after a month everything returned to normal, other than my foot. I had several follow up appointments with a neurologist to find nothing and i have basically been dismissed. The tingling is starting again and i do not want to go through the whole process again. I do suffer from migraines, but they are fairly well controlled wih 50mg of amitriptyline daily before bed (also used to help with sleeping) and sumatriptan for when a migraine does occur. I have not had a migraine for two months, which is much better than the weekly migraine I was victim to and the week long migraine during menstruation.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have diabetes 2 and the last 4 or 5 days I am extremely thirsty.  No matter what I drink it doesnt help.  Most of the time I wake up nauseas.  I have Diarrhea and sometimes its just like water.  It gets to the point where I start throwing up and then I feel a little better.,"Hello, Thanks for the query. Diabetes if uncontrolled there will be high blood glucose. This leads to excess glucose being excreted from urine causing increased frequency and quantity of urine. In turn there will be more thirst. Plus since you have watery diarrhea, that also increases thirst. The reason for diarrhea can be gastrointestinal infection, which also leads to nausea and vomiting.  So first thing is to achieve strict blood glucose control, that will improve over all health.  Plus there may be a need for oral rely Chat Doctor.  Plus you may need a course of ornidazole plus ofloxacin for five days.  Plus if nausea and vomiting persist an anti-emetic like Domeperidone 10 mg once or twice a Dy is also needed. Thanks."

I read your question and understood your concern. You may have plantar fasciitis, so I recommend you to use custom-made shoe inserts with arch supports. Also check your osteoporosis as you may need calcium and vitamin D medication. Diabetes affects also the nerves of the legs, so you take medication for neuropathic pain such as LYRICS. Non weight-bearing exercise and sport such as swimming, water Derby and stationary bike is good for you to lose weight but not walking nor jogging."

However, in long-standing diabetes peripheral neuropathy does occur. But the effect is most often seen in lower limbs - legs and feet first. Later it may spread to hands and arms. Most often uncontrolled high blood glucose remaining for many years is the cause.  But even with fairly well controlled diabetes of long-standing these symptoms are seen.

I am also paranoid that I might have breast cancer, but I am too scared to get it checked out. Ive felt my breasts before, but I cant tell if I have lumps or if thats just how my breasts are, because Ive had one lump in each breast since Ive developed them. One time before I went to shower, a little bit of puss came out of my left nipple, it made me worried but I dont want to go tell my mom this. Anything suspicious? Any advice?","Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. Is is not at all normal to get the stomach ache and nausea every night. This indicates that you have a problem of acidity and HERD. You are giving a history of being paranoid yourself, you can not have breast cancer at the age of 17. One lump each breast has to be investigated by getting physical examination, mammography and if the diagnosis is of a fibroadenoma or fibroadenomas, get the lump removed and get histopathological examination done to make sure that you do not have a cancer. There are many reasons of having pus from the nipples. Get investigated, get the pus culture and sensitivity done, and tell your Mother and the Doctor about this."

I am a 58 year old woman in seemingly good health. The twinges arent painful, just a weird sensation and seems to have gotten worse, and now travel all over my belly. I have asked a few doctors when I get check ups and they just say nerves.","Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history, history of what other Doctors suggested, like just nerves. I do not think so, these are not just nerves. You have mentioned specifically about the twinges on the right of your belly, more pronounced at the night; feels like bubble bursting or small wire bending, seems to have gotten worse and now travel all over the belly. I would think abut the following in such a case:-This can be a subacute intestinal obstruction, not sufficient to cause acute pain.- Lymph nodal mass in the center - mesentery,-Rare chance of Gastrointestinal cancer. I would advise you the following, please discuss and insist with your Doctors:-X-ray of the abdomen in standing position;-Ultrasonography and if required CT scan of the abdomen. -Clinical examination of the abdomen by a Gastroenterologist and preferable a Surgeon.-Investigations of the blood- particularly to rule out diabetes, Typhoid, liver and renal functions.-Urine and stool examination;-Endoscopies if required and advised by Castro.

Thank you, Sally","Hi Sally, Pregnancy, especially the later months can make women who are prone to get diabetes in the future have high sugar levels. Yes, 141 is a high value, and you need to have a detailed sugar level done. Also, you need to take care of your diet and check your sugar levels before and after meals.

Trichomoniasis is a protozoal infection spread mostly by sexual relations (vaginal, oral or anal sex).  - Only possibility of its nonsexual transmission can be use of contaminated towel / from a toilet seat.  - Many a times symptoms are evident earlier in women due to the peculiar physical conditions & though male partner is infected he may not suffer from the symptoms.  -Itching & white discharge is seen in females with diabetes/ after menopause due to vaginal Candidiasis...(which is not sexually transmitted) & it can be differentiated from trichomoniasis by careful inspection/ microscopic swab testing.

I have had numerous stones, have never been able to pass any of them on my own. Have had a 24 hour urine and stone analysis that showed calcium oxalate and really try to do the diet recommended. I continue to form stones...the last one about 1 year ago requiring basket extraction. Is this size stone passable without intervention. I have had lithotripsey 2 -3 times and my old urologist said I could no longer do it as there is a risk of shock injury to my pancreas and potential for developing diabetes??? Is this true.? I have a new Dr (because other retired) and he wants to do litho. What are my options? Also, my pain is intermittent at times and at other times is constant and is located right at my Left kidney region. Do you only experience pain when it is in the ureters. Does the kidney itself have pain nerve endings? Can these pass or what is the size stone that is to large to pass.","HelloThnks for query. You are known to get recurrence of urinary stones mostly due to metabolic disorder. Now you have four stones in Left kidney bigger one of the size of 7 mm. Normally stone up to size of 8 mm can be expected to pass out spontaneously.However, there are multiple factors that govern the passage of stone out 1) Shape of the stone 2) Diameter of mouth of calyx. The pain occurs even when the stone is in kidney and occurs when it gets impacted at the mouth of calyx causing distention of calyx due to accumulation of urine in calyx. As regards no of lithography that one can be subjected to I would say that due to advanced technology and modern lithography machines one can have ESL for plenty of times and there is no danger to pancreas or any other organ. Since you have stone of a size of 7 mm and less you can expect them to pass out spontaneously. If they fail to pass down within a month you can go ahead for ESL. Chat Doctor. "

I went to my doctors and today I had blood tests for all sorts of things....diabetes, thyroid, bones...because I have a lot of pain in my joints, cholesterol. I suppose my question is would the head shaking be related to any of the things I have been tested for? It does worry me as I work with elderly people and I see it a lot in our clients who have Parkinsons. I am due to go back to my doctors on the 29th of this month for the results of the blood tests but am afraid of what he is going to tell me. Steph","Head shaking or tremors of the head are much more commonly associated with a condition known as BENIGN ESSENTIAL TREMOR (BET) rather than PARKINSON DISEASE (PD) although some Parkinson's patients certainly do have elements of essential tremor present when the disease is advanced such as head and jaw tremoring....but in benign essential tremor head bobbing or shaking is a common finding.  Blood tests are usually negative for any abnormality if the diagnosis is truly one of either BET or PD. Good luck....it would be very pleasing to me to know that you will quit smoking in this New Year since I can almost guarantee that as physically fit as you are at this time.... I will nearly guarantee feeling ad being able to perform physically nearly 10x better if you would give up the cigarettes....not to mention how money you could donate extra if you'd like to your favorite charity!  ;)I very much doubt you are developing any symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of PD.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. You should not worry. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. A typical heart pain has some characteristics. They are retro-sternal pains likes quizzing, tightness or heaviness. They may irradiate to both arms, jaw and last from 5 to 20 minutes. A typical heart pain and heart attack usually affect older ages and persons with different risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, smokers and with hereditary of ischemic heart disease. As you are very young, and you have not a typical pain the risk of heart attach is low (rare). In my opinion you have nothing to worry about because these pains are probably related to Herd or your Costco Chat Doctor. HERD is quite known to give such pains like heart burning sensations. Anyway if this symptoms persist after treating HERD I will recommend to do some simple examinations like an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo and a street test. Hope I was helpful.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Dear Dr. Nitin Rao, I hope you ll be fine and doing great. I consider myself lucky to ask a health related query to such an erudite person like you. Well, my father just got his blood sugar tested some days ago. Test values are as below: (Fasting=123 & Random=297)mg/dl He is so worried about this that he suffered from diabetes. We do not have any diabetic history in our whole family both from my father and mother side. Since the day of my father s blood sugar test, he has started daily walk in evening time of about 3kms atleast. Furthermore, he has also skipped sugar and other fatty foods like burgers, pizzas etc. Please guide what else my father should do to keep diabetes away. One important thing, my father is very fond of milk, can he drink milk or not ? My Father s Details: Age: 59 Height=5 feet 11 inches. Weight: (90 - 93) KG Looking forward your your kind and expert opinion. Best Regards | Faraz Saleem","Thankyou for your query. As per your fathers blood glucose levels he is diagnosed case of diabetes. Moreover, his BMI shows that he is overweight. There is absolutely no reason to panic. All you have to do is to start antidiabetic Chat Doctor.  You can start tab gliclazide 30 mg once, half an hour before breakfast and 500 mg tab metformin half an hour after dinner. Along with this he has to work up on his diet plan also. He should follow frequent (5 times) and short meals. He can take oats, cornflakes, sprouts, or a glass of skimmed milk, tea (either with sugar-free or without sugar). After two hours he can either take a bowl full of rice or 2 multigrain chapatis, bowl of green leafy vegetables, nuts, curd (fat free) or butter milk at lunch. Then he can take some oil free snacks at evening tea and then repeat the same regime as has been told for lunch. Keep changing oil from mustard to olive to sunflower or safflower oil. Apart from this he should do 30 minutes of brisk walking or 30 minutes of aerobics. After following this schedule if his fasting and post radial sugar comes down then stick to the same regime, else add 15 mg of pioglitazone. Contact for further query. Feel free to contact any time.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi Dr. a very good evening.I am residing in bangalore,and I am writing this for my son.He is 19 years of age and doing his B-Tech  5th semester. Dr., for the past six months he is suffering from urinary infection. And I have consulted him with many urologists, still he didnt get a complete recovery. His ultrasound report,blood sugar, uroflam test everithing is normal. During this period he gets high fever & severe head ache, so bad that he cannot move his head in any direction.Im very worried about his head ache and other symptoms. He has taken many antibiotics .It didnt work it is recurrent now. Now, his Dr. has prescribed an antibiotic called urifast, daily two times for 14 days & then he has to take this tablet for 2 months, once daily and, his Dr. told him to take IVU X-RAY also.Dr is there any problem for taking this antibiotic such a long period.HIS IMMUNITY IS VERY POOR.Any weather change he falls sick.Pls help my son. Dr. his body wt is about 94 kg.","Hi dear, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor. I have read your question well and understand your concern and I will do my best to assist you. There are few questions I would like to ask to better understand your case such as has your son lost weight recently? You said his weight was 94KG? Has he lost or gained weight in the last 6 months? Does he have any history of Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis, does he take any medications that reduce his immunity? Now if I answer based on the information you provided. First, one thing you should know is that male Urinary tract infection are mostly difficult trace or manage compared to females, its more likely to see a recurrent female infection than male. I don't know what made your doctor to treat your son with only antibiotic medications, if I was your Doctor I would consider admitting him to hospital so that I can take all necessary tests required, I would also consider treating him by giving him IV solution to help him rely Chat Doctor.  The ICU test the doctor ordered is a good choice to look for any abnormalities in the whole urinary tract including kidneys. Here are few things I would do if you came to my Hospital, you can consider discussing the following with your Doctor.1. Admit to hospital immediately, so that I can give IV fluids and IV antibiotics and run tests such as CBC, Urinalysis, Urine culture, ICU. 2. Since your son had recurrent UTI, I might consider doing some other tests to see if he has other co-morbidities such as diabetes, Tuberculosis etc.3. Some patient that had recurrent UTI might actually have something called Fistulas caused by a disease known as Crohn's disease. Therefore, if ICU shows normal results, I will refer him to Gastroenterology specialist to do Colonoscopy. Specially if your son suffers from diarrhea Crohn's disease is an Inflammatory Bowel disease that causes severe abdominal pain and could lead to forming fistula (holes between intestines and urinary tract) that might cause some bacteria from the Intestines to reach to the urinary tracts thus cause a Urinary tract infection. I hope you can discuss the points i mentioned with your current Doctor, so they can consider it.  Wish you all the best and I hope your son gets better soon."

I am experiencing significant (obvious) swelling in my feet, ankles and calves almost every day. It goes away overnight (while I am asleep in bed) but seems to show up again every evening. I also experience puffiness in my face. I am overweight but not obese, and I walk at least 1.5 miles every day.

I have gone through your query and understood your concerns! Thank you for sharing them on Chat Doctor. We can't be sure that these symptoms you are experiencing now indicate heart failure without doing some examinations. Usually swollen ankles and feet are found in heart congestive failure, but in these cases, feet and ankles are more swollen in the evening and less in the morning. Kidney problems, diabetes, thyroid problems etc., may lead to similar symptoms. So to determine the real cause of these concerns I would recommend you to do some examinations to let us know more about your health.- Blood pressure monitoring-Blood sugar and lipids-Urine test, proteinuria- Liver enzymes, and kidney function indicators (creatinine, urea)- ECG-Heart ultrasound examination and cardiologist consultation doctor may ask for more examinations if he sees reasonable.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have no diabetes or no high blood pressure and do a lot of walking. My microalbumin urine is 381mg/l but my creatinine is 4.2mmol/l. Do I have kidney disease? i am very active normally and but have been using simvastatin to control my cholesterol over last 2 years( around 5.2mmol/l). Thank you,"Hello! Yes, your concern is very true. Raised creatinine level indicates either obstructive myopathy or Medico-renal disease i.e. obstruction to urine outflow or dysfunction of parenchymal (functional tissue) of kidneys. Obstruction can be due to many causes like stones/strictures/growths or pressure on urinary tubes (ureters/urethra) from outside i.e. growths from surrounding structures like rectum/uterus/colon etc. In my clinic, I advise X-ray PUB, ultrasound abdomen & pelvis, urine routine, renal function tests, serum uric acid. Treatment is accordingly. Hope this information is useful to you. Wish you healthy life. Thanks. Regards."

Based on the facts of your query the reply of your query is-Your current health issues seem to be due to -Long Standing and Advanced Varicose Veins of the Scrotum-which was not noticed / or was not cared unknowingly. This needs to be verified with other causes of large Scrotum-which could be due to accompanied- Inguino-scrotal hernia/ or accompanied Filial Scrotal enlargement. The Cause of this in your case needs to be investigated. Other causes need to be verified, as discussed above. For this you need to consult Surgeon and Urologist from Surgical Department. Remedy-Dos in your case-Check With Doctor-Rest-for few days-4-5 days-with head low would help you to strengthen the Varicose rupture site and would avoid recurrence in time to come.you need to Urgently plan Micro-Vascular Surgery for correcting the varicose veins in Varicocele which many need ELVT-endoscopic laser ablation of the engorged communicating vessels and Foam chemotherapy to reduce the engorged mass, as your case is advanced Varicocele. Bleeding from the Scrotal Varicose Veins - is not a normal process, and indicates long-standing Varicose veins with thinned out skin over it, with minimal trauma causing bleeding -as happened in your caseReduce on obesity by strict dieting plans from nutritionist and family GP. Check Testosterone / LH/ FSH and thyroid and blood sugar levels, which could be low due to long-standing Varicose Veins of the Scrotum-Varicocele and fix if diabetes/hypothyroidism is the cause of obesity in your case. Get physical check with Urologist who do USG and Color Doppler studies to assess the severity of Varicocele / with accompanied testes atrophy -if it's there. There are many causes which need to be verified amongst the causes discussed above before planning specific surgical remedy in your case. High protein low Calories/low fat / high fiber diet to built up body muscle mass and loose obesity. Proper Gaming and walking exercises would help you a lot but under guidance of Physician-as to avoid more ruptures due to uncontrolled exercises, due to increased abdominal and venous pressure. Vit B12 and Folic Acid- to stabilize aid BMR rise and reduction of obesity.Thus, You should consult Urologist and Physician. This would resolve the complaints of yours.

When I had my first attunement my teacher let us know our bodies would be going through changes.

I have terrible skin reactions to most chemicals , exposures to metals, a label of a snapple bottle touching the skin of the arm, and even things that are hypo allergenic or designed for sensitive skin . (Triple antibiotic ointments and other commonly used products) I cannot eat red meat anymore, something I enjoyed as I now have severe migraines even with the smallest of portions. The smell of cooked meat is unbearable whereas before I had no problem with it.

I have been on so many antibiotics in the first year since the changes they are no longer effective.

The whole left side of my back, and from my hip to my knee on one side of my body at different times, always in large areas.) I tested negative for diabetes, and negative for HIV.

I am at a loss of the cause of the rashes, and intolerance to foods I used to be able to eat.

A cancer esophagus stage 4b has a guarded prognosis and patient survival might be extended to 2 years. It will help to know which part of the esophagus is involved. The esophagus is a tubular structure connecting mouth to stomach. It has an upper mid and lower third. The exact region of cancer and its extent is important to know. Placement of stent is done to clear the luminal obstruction. I guess the cancer is in mid or lower third and therefore stent is in place. Since chemotherapy is unlikely therefore the doctors might suggest radiation therapy as one of the treatment options. This might help to suppress the tumor for few months and delay progression of disease. The prognosis in his case might be 6 months to slightly over a year if he is able to have oral foods containing nutrients. Please do not worry."

But you can decide whether it is shingles or not, from the following.1)Shingles appears years after you had a chickenpox.2)Tingling, numbness,and pain precedes development of the lesion.3)The lesion appear as group of fluid filled vesicles.4)It will be present on one side only(right/left). It will not cross the mid-line of our body.5)recurrent attacks are rare, unless we have immune compromising conditions like uncontrolled diabetes/HIV/connective tissue disorders/other chronic illnesses. It can usually be treated with antivirals like acyclovir, analgesics,and vitamin supplements. If this is not the case, you pleas follow your dermatologist. I hope you will find this information useful. Thank you."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, last night I experienced something unusual that I cannot really explain it. I felt like my heart was gonna stop. Today my upper back hurts right in the middle. I cant really tell if its my spine that hurts too. My left hand hurts, kind of tingling too. Minor chest pain also appeared. Am I at risk of getting a stroke or heart attack?","Hi, Your symptoms looks very atypical. Chances of getting a heart attack depends on multiple things like age, sex (male are at more risk), associated risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, smoking, abnormal lipid profile. So you need to do certain tests to rule out the cardiac events like ECG and 2D Echo. Also check your BP and blood sugars routinely for risk assessment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Thanks, Chat Doctor. "

Please suggest what is the current status for her?","Hi and thanks for the query, The results of the serum creatinine levels are NOT within limits. This therefore compels a critical follow-up and management. Also, the fluctuation means that there might be some underlying fluctuating factor which needs identification. The values of the potassium levels deserve the evaluation by Kidney specialist (Nephrologist). Conditions like diabetes mellitus, hypertension if present must be properly managed.

Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I carefully passed through your question and would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some tests: - a resting ECG-complete blood count and Hemoglobin electrophoresis- thyroid hormone levels-fasting glucose and HbA1C for diabetes. The vertigo could be related to the arthritis in your neck (chronic degeneration of the cervical column). Anemia can exacerbate all this clinical situation, causing low blood pressure and low oxygenation of the brain cells. So, the main thing to do in this situation is tried a cervical collar, treat anemia and perform a cervical MRI study in order to examine better your cervical spine and rule in/out the possibility of surgery.

Still going on alternate day dialysis.He is also a BP, diabatic and heart patient, in the 2D echo report it showed that his heart pumping is 40%.Please suggest us and let us know that is there a chances of kidney recovery so that we can stop dialysis and start medication. Thanks advance...Regards,Abdul Hamed","Hi and thank you so much for trusting us with your health query. I am so sorry to hear about this kidney problem your father has. The indication of this dialysis does not really suggest that dialysis would soon be stopped. The reduction in creatinine level is thanks to the dialysis and not a recovery of the renal function. Patients with diabetes and hypertension most commonly go down with chronic renal failure which requires lifelong dialysis as opposed to acute that requires a short term dialysis. Because I lack the information concerning the exact diagnosis and indication for the dialysis, I will suggest you ask the nephrologist what the plan is. The definite way to get a patient with chronic kidney disease off dialysis is kidney transplant. I hope you find this helpful. Thank you so much for using our services, and please feel free to for more information or clarifications if need be. I wish your father the best of health."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have some pain associated with peripheral neuropathy related to diabetes myelitis. The doctor has prescribed gabapentin. The paperwork that came with it causes me some concern as to whether or not this is the correct medicine for me. WHat do you think,"Hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. You should know that Diabetic neuropathy has no known cure like all the other complications of Diabetes mellitus. Treatment for diabetic neuropathy focuses on relieving pain and slowing the progression of the disease. It is very important to keep blood sugar within a target range. This can help delay the progression of diabetic neuropathy and may even improve some symptoms you already have. Gabapenrin is an anti -leisure medication, and it is used to treat nerve pain. Based on current practice guidelines, the first-line treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain includes tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline). If these agents are contraindicated, newer anticonvulsant (gabapentin, pregabalin) should be considered. In my opinion, your doctor has carefully considered your functional status and potential adverse effects of gabapentin when he chose the treatment for your painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. So, My answer is:Yes, Gabapentin is advisable for pain related to peripheral neuropathy. It is a ""good"" treatment, and you have no reason to be concerned. Stay in contact with your treating doctor for every problem you may have during the therapy. Hope this is helpful. If you have other question, feel free and ask. Best regards."

Can fibroids contribute to a miscarriage and/or infertility? The only symptom I have is a bloated tummy but otherwise my periods are fine.","Hi, There are multiple problems concerned in your case. I would have liked to know your previous pregnancies were assisted or natural conception. There can be multiple causes for infertility. Yes, fibroid can be one of the causes of infertility but rarely by itself can cause recurrent miscarriages. However, It's important to know the size and location of fibroid for considering its treatment. I hope you have checked your sugars after your pregnancy, as it may persist even after pregnancy in few people. I would advise you to meet your gynecologist and consider starting the infertility treatment at the earliest, specially considering your age. All the best."

She had transient ischemic attack last week and we recently discovered she has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation through ekg. She has a history of hypertension and diabetes but these two are well controlled within this year. She had an echocardiogram last August 2010 with mild tricuspid regurgitation. I have these questions: 1. Is atrial fibrillation the cause of my mothers stroke for the past years which was not detected until recently.? 2. Does tricuspid valve regurgitation caused her atrial fibrillation?","Hey, Regarding the answers to your question1) AF is a very common cause of stroke. It may remain undetected for years and may present first time as stroke when the ECG shows AF. So yes it may be old which has caused stroke2) Mild TR generally does not cause any problem and may be physiological in some patients. IT DOES NOT CAUSE AF until any chamber of the heart is dilated because of significant TR. As your mother is diabetic and hypertensive, she is at high risk of coronary disease, which may cause AF. So ruling out that is also important after she is stabilized. Thanks Chat Doctor. "

The subfraction of VLDL known as VLDL3 is the densest form of VLDL and increases your risk for heart disease, blood clots and diabetes.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have a siix year old girl.am trying to get preg for 4years but did not work.i visit a doc this month and he gav letrozole 5mg and ovidac after. But am pcos .am 90kg.will it be risky for me? And coz ovidac wil it harm th baby with defects?? Is it risky to concive with pcos ??i dont hav diabtic,colestorol,pressure...nothing but fat.pls advice in detaill thanx","Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Letrozole is a strong fertility medication that can produce ovulation in women who normally do not ovulate, such as women with PCs. The Ovid ac injection just induces you to ovulate at the correct time in your cycle to correspond usually with a timed insemination, either by intercourse, or by GUI. The fertility medication itself does not cause any risk to the baby if you do conceive, because the medications only affect your ovulation and ability to conceive. However, fertility medications such as Metronome can produce high order multiple gestation (triplets and above) in women with PCs because PCs is a disease where women have many immature eggs waiting to be released. If you successfully conceive only one baby, your pregnancy is no more a risk than any other obese woman.  You will have a higher risk of diabetes and high blood pressure during your pregnancy, and they should be tested for and monitored carefully, but with proper prenatal care women with PCs and obesity can have successful pregnancies. So in summary, the fertility medications that you have been treated with really only increase the risk of conceiving multiple babies at the same time.  The medications do not cause birth defects and are out of your system by the time you actually get pregnant. However, unless you have already tried milder ovulation induction medications (not injections) that failed in the past, I caution against the use of Metronome as women with PCs frequently conceive multiple eggs at the same time and twins or even higher order multiple pregnancies are possible. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and I wish you the best in conceiving a healthy pregnancy. Best wishes,"

I went to my OB/GYN last Saturday and was sent to do a repeat chlamydia test and a urine analysis - see suspects UTI. I am waiting for my results. She prescribed Gynotran Vaginal cream and dicoflenac tabs to help with the pain. Last night (day 5) I had sex after applying the treatment which I know I should not have been having sex until after the seven days. I would like to know what happens now, what should I expect and should I restart the treatment? My husband woke up this morning with his penis shaft burning. Thanks in advance.","When were these abortions? How long ago? Why did u induce it? If u had conceived already then everything-the tubes, the ovaries and the uterus are all working. So I think most probably the previous abortions were sporadic. You could test for anti phospholipid antibodies and do basic screening of your sugars to rule out diabetes as you complain of repeated infections and abortions. Hope it helped. Waiting to hear.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Dear Drs,My father has been diagnosed with lung and adrenal gland cancer, in which the spreading point was from his lungs. We asked for more than one medical opinion regarding his treatment and basically we have two options; the first is to conduct several extensive chemotherapy sessions and then switch to radiotherapy or surgery. The second was that his condition was very rare that it can be treated by surgery first and then less sessions of chemotherapy can be conducted. I know that the immunity for a person gets very low after having chemotherapy and I am really concerned of him having chemotherapy first and surgery afterwards, so I want to ask which of the two options is a better one? And whether there are any other options for treatment? My father is 63 years old, a smoker, has type II diabetes, and had successful colon cancer surgery in 1983.I would really appreciate your medical opinion in this case and hope to get your answer very soon.Thank you,Tina","Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Hr has lung cancer and spread into a Chat Doctor.  Treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. According to my opinion first he should go for chemotherapy then afterward he can go with surgery and radiotherapy.

As you have already performed all the test and came out negative I feel this could be a neurological issue. Like the nerve pinching. As nerve carries the functions of the sensory system any disruption in the nerve route may lead to such symptoms. I will advise you to perform core stability exercises and also spine muscle Strengthening exercises by which the nerve pinch can be removed, and the symptoms will be reduced as well. Since it is a harmless and no effects are there I will advise you to do exercises. Many cases in my clinical experience has responded well to physical therapy alone with exercises for the spine stability. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "

I passed carefully through your history and would explain that his blood pressure values are not too low to cause fainting or dizziness. Orthostatic hypotension could be the cause of his symptomatology. I recommend measuring his blood pressure during sitting and standing up position. If there is a decrease in his blood pressure more than 20mmHg during standing up position, compared to sitting position, this could indicate orthostatic hypotension. A Head up Tilt test is needed to rule in/out this disorder. I would also recommend performing some other tests to exclude other possible causes related to his heart: - a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound-some blood lab tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose and HbA1C). If orthostatic hypotension is confirmed some modifications to his actual therapy may be needed. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Greetings!"

My hemoglobin count is  6.8my doctor said, my kidneys are functioning at 17%. but I do not have any symptoms. can this be true? what can be the treatment?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Diabetes and hypertension are the main reasons of kidney disease in Indians. It is well known that diabetes and hypertension targets the kidney function in the glomerulus and causes nephropathy. It begins by permitting proteins to be excreted in urine and this progressively increases with time. After few years the renal function goes down and the protein excretion increases. This starts a cascade of events terminating in increasing serum creatinine level and the kidney starts to shrink. Once there is chronic kidney disease grade III then reversibility is difficult. Anemia also is responsible for progressive kidney function deterioration. The kidney releases erythropoietin which is a molecule to increase the hemoglobin and if there is kidney disease then this is not secreted in adequate amount and the cycle repeats. Please discuss your condition with your doctor. Please do not worry."

In your case, probably high cholesterol and diabetes are responsible for your fatty liver and high liver enzymes. There is a lot of controversy regarding the medication as many gastroenterologists feel that medicines like PROTOCOL have no use. The best and ideal treatment is quit alcohol, if any, control your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, do regular exercises and shed your weight. Get your liver enzymes tested after 3 months.

In my opinion the first sign of pregnancy is missed period. The other signs of pregnancy are nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts start at 6 weeks or 2 weeks after missed period. But any of the above signs should be associated with a positive pregnancy test. So in case of pregnancy there will be positive pregnancy test. And the fetal movements are perceived around 5 months of pregnancy. Anyway definite confirmation is done by ultrasound. If nothing is seen in ultrasound and negative pregnancy test the pregnancy is ruled out. Sometimes the thought of pregnancy also makes one to feel the pregnancy symptoms. So relax. Best regards..."

The endocrinologist insists on me taking Metformin to prolong any onset of diabetes. Could this medication be causing this numbness? It happens no matter what type of she I wear, so he can t be the shoes.","Hello, Thanks for writing to us, I have read your query, Toe numbness can be due to pinched nerve in spine. Due to compression of nerve root there can be tingling numbness in your foot. I will advise you to do MRI spine and EMG-NCV [Nerve conduction study] and consult to orthopedic surgeon. Peripheral numbness is common in diabetic, but incidence is low in prediabetic.  Change your diet and remove inflammatory foods such as citrus fruits, dairy products and wheat that may aggravate peripheral neuropathy. Simultaneously increase your intake of potassium and calcium-rich foods such as bananas and avocados and green leafy vegetable. Vitamin B12 is important in the maintenance of health and normal functioning of the nerve tissue and deficiency of it can lead to numbness. You can increase B12 level by taking meat and fish, or you can take In methylcobalamine. Hope this answers your query.

In general all analgesics have adverse effects on kidney function and are not indicated in kidney disease. Tornado also belongs to the family of analgesics that inhibit vasodilator substance called as prostaglandins to elicit its action. Inhibiting such vasodilator agent will further reduce your kidney function. Although such medications are contra-indicated, under unavoidable conditions such as yours (fore-mentioned inflammatory conditions) sporadic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) may be used but only under medical supervision. I will advise you to consult your primary physician for any use of analgesics. Regardless of any choice of painkillers please increase the amount of fluid intake and avoid any consumption of alcohol. Lastly, please make sure that your physician knows about all medicines you are taking, even over-the-counter medications. Hope this helps."

There are both male and female factors contributing to infertility like :-Female factors:-Hormonal abnormalities like thyroid abnormalities, progesterone insufficiency, polycystic ovarian disease (POD), diabetes,high prolactin hormone levels, tubal block etc. Male factors:-low sperm count or poor quality of semen or any ejaculatory problems etc. So all the above causes in both the partners should be evaluated. If both of you have all normal findings, and you have regular cycles then it is called unexplained infertility.Don't worry. Avoidance of stress and anxiety regarding pregnancy is very much important as they cause hormonal imbalance and delay fertility further. Practice regular intercourse to increase the conception chances. Relax. You are on correct line of treatment. Fertyl helps in inducing the ovulation. And intrauterine insemination also has successful results if natural pregnancy fails. There are also many advanced techniques available for infertility presently. Hope this helps. Best regards..."

And everything is normal. But right from starting my weight increased by 10kg (from 56 to 66 kg now). Is this increase in weight will give any risk during normal delivery ?This is my first baby.","Hello dear, I understand your concern. Usually the required weight gain in pregnancy depends on the pre-pregnancy weight. If the pre-pregnancy weight is :-1)Normal weight:-about 11-16 kg of weight gain is desirable.2)If overweight or obesity-not more than 7 kg.3)If underweight-upto 18 kg weight is desirable. So if the weight gain is more than the desired one any high BP and any diabetes in mother should be ruled out. So I suggest you to consult doctor and get BP and blood sugars done to rule out hypertension and diabetes. If they are normal nothing to worry. And depending on your pre-pregnancy weight check your weight gain. If the weight gain seems more avoid high carboy Chat Doctor. Avoid stress. Nothing to worry. Hope this helps. Best regards....."

Still sore but now so as my virgina......not sure what to do...what would you suggest?","Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. Green poo is suggestive of an infection of the intestines and a proper course of antibiotics will help to cure this; which will automatically help the pain in abdomen to subside. You can certainly undergo tests of blood, particularly for diabetes, urine and stool-stool culture and sensitivity too. This will help if the infection is resistant to routine antibacterial agents."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have a boil on my penis for the third time in two months. I have done antibiotic treatment twice with good success. Today the boil was even larger and more painful so I pinched it and a fair amount of pus erupted. Should I take another course of antibiotics? And was pinching it the wrong thing to do even though it feels much better now?,"Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Recurrent skin infection in the form of boils occurring on penis despite taking treatment with antibiotics could be due to resistance of the organisms for the antibiotics previously used. Once the pus comes out, you would always feel better. Anyway, kindly get the following things done so that it would be helpful to treat your condition better. 1. Culture of pus or swab from the secretions of the boil and its sensitivity to know what could be the organism and which antibiotic it is sensitive to. 2. Random Blood Sugar (RBS) to know the status of glucose homeostasis as repeated infection could be caused due to diabetes mellitus. Kindly keep the area clean and hygienic. In the meantime, you can wash the area with mild antiseptic solution using Iodine or Salon. Also, you can apply Aureomycin ointment over the lesions. If glucose levels are normal, take a complete course of appropriate antibiotics after the culture and sensitivity report along with anti-inflammatory medication like Ibuprofen. Gradually, your symptoms should subside, and you should feel better. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."

I had a severe bout of depression and anxiety recently, which I am being treated for, but I have since been feeling more cognitively slow, and have some tremors in my hands at times, and some muscular twitches in various parts of my body.  I had an MRI to rule out MS (which my mother had), and they found microvascular ischemic changes bilaterally in my brain.  The neurologist said this amount was pretty average for my age.  I also recently had a cardiac calcium score done - it is 1.  Should I be concerned about this MRI?  At the height of my depression, I was in bed for 3 days with severe headaches (I also have cervical spine degeneration) but I actually felt like I had had a mini-stroke.  Has my brain had little mini-strokes, thus the ischemic changes?","Hello. I read your query and I understand your concern. Technically speaking those ischemic changes are a part of the stroke spectrum, meaning it is a case of an occluded vessel not supplying enough blood. However, it is the case of very small vessels and what your neurologist meant is that a certain amount of these changes of small vessels happens in many people over the course of years and are not responsible for your symptoms, can be found in many other people your age without any symptom at all. If these changes are markedly widespread it could be a cause for cognitive changes, I can't evaluate that without the images, but since he has told you they are average for your age I suppose he has considered that. So you shouldn't be concerned too much, although you should pay attention to blood pressure and high cholesterol to lower your future risk of stroke (a recommendation which would be given even without that MRI). I hope to have been of help."

If you have lost your spontaneously, I would recommend you to consult with your GP for a careful examination and perform some tests like: -routine blood test-fasting glucose-kidney and liver function tests-blood electrolytes-chest x-ray -abdominal ultrasound-inflammation tests -some cancer antigens blood tests. Sometimes a spontaneous excessive weight loss in a short period of time can be a sign of cancer or a metabolic disorder, including a thyroid dysfunction and diabetes. Hope to have been helpful!

She also is complaining of her body jumping while she is asleep. She is not a diabetic but does have eczema. Are the body jumping symptoms r/t the microvascular disease?","Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that body jumping is not a typical sign of microvascular disease. Microvascular brain disease is usually related to chronic uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes. It can lead to small strokes or progressive dementia.

From the information you provided seems like your father has an advanced heart block which impairs normal cardiac function. His associated diseases may further complicate his heart condition. Heart block is defined as blockage of signal conduction from sing atrial node to both ventricles.

Looking at your complaints my opinion is as follows.1. Causes of High blood pressure is multifactorial. Apart from the parameters you mentioned, there are other factors too like stress, lifestyle, type of personality, exercise and workout, nutrition, history of hypertension/diabetes in family, history of myocardial infarction in family, hypercholesterolemia which contribute to pressures. 2. Keep a checklist on the factors I have mentioned and if your answer is yes to any or few of those then chances of developing hypertension and complications arising out of hypertension is more.3. Get a lipid profile tested to rule out high cholesterol as possible cause.4. If your BP reading is consistently high on multiple occasions then it's better to start on antihypertensives, and make necessary lifestyle modifications. Hope this helps.

Please type your query here...Hi i want to ask about albumine in urine i have a little amount of albumine in my urine i want to know how much the amount of albumine is normal in urine if it is in traces then.","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Albumin should not be present in urine. The total amount of protein in urine should be less they 150 mg/24 hours. Presence of albumin between 30-300 mg.DL is called microalbuminuria.

Thus, get your blood glucose levels checked and consult your nephrologist. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","19 yo Male About 6 months ago, I snorted .3mg of pure methamphetamine in a matter of an hour or two. I ve had a history of amphetamine/coke use prior to this but the symptoms always seemed to be gone after a couple days.. A few days after trying meth for the first time I felt like my blood circulation was off and my legs/feet were Tingly/Sweaty/Numb . Then 2 months later, I had to go see a doctor because my feet were so red, almost purple that It was unbearable for me to manage the pain. Excessive sweating in my feet, hands, depression. I can still feel my feet, had multiple tests done of doctors poking them with a tooth pick. It s just the tingling sensation, the sweating and the urge of not having any desire to wake up in the morning. I feel like all these symptoms are related to REALLY poor blood circulation. I know I don t have diabetes, had a series of blood tests done which all came back negative. I m 100% sure that these symptoms came from meth. My question to you is what should I do to finally get rid of the pain? I know that cayenne, garlic helps with the blood flow. I also started to exercise recently, but that doesn t seem to be helping. My muscles used to twitch a lot all over my body for no apparent reason, and my heart rate was really high for the longest time, but it seemed to gotten a lot better. It s the tingling all over my legs/arms, really sweaty feet and being cold in an 80 degree room that REALLY BOTHERS me..I hope you can provide me with some promising treatments. As for the doctors I saw, they didn t do much. Wouldn t give me any meds for pain or something to improve my circulation or heart rate. They just wanted me to get an MRI then to go see a cardiologist and have some more tests done...I don t have the greatest insurance to cover up all these expenses so I just thought As long as I m not having a heart attack or a stroke, I should be good . But the tingling is really annoying and at times, unbearable .","Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. You had visited some doctors, and you say that they did not help much. They did not help because that is the treatment you needed then. Doctors never advice Psychiatry treatment unless they feel confirmed. Otherwise, they just motivate the patient and leave them. They know in a span of around of some days, the patient gets better. That is life and its teachings. You should understand that you are not depressed. You are dissatisfied, disappointed. Furthermore, you are anxious due to that. Furthermore, you felt tingling, and you related it with your health or mental health. Now you are obsessed with that tingling and become anxious. The tingling is not actually real. It is just your creation. You must treat your anxiety or obsession. Consult a psychologist for psychotherapy. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",My 18 month has a red dot in the white of her eye - doesnt seem to be bothered by it and no other symptons but I dont know if it could be something to worry about it? Do you know what causes this and if she should see a doctor? Will the red dot go away on its own?,"I am pleasure to answer your question. The red spot you see is most likely a small blood vessel. In medical terms, it is called a subconjunctival hemorrhage. Small blood vessels lie underneath the conjunctiva, the clear coating that covers the sclera, the white part of the eye. But most often feel no pain, irritation or light sensitivity. A subconjunctival hemorrhage can occur if a person has too much pressure on the upper part of the body or head. Pressure can be created by straining too hard while lifting something very heavy or coughing or sneezing. Straining during constipation can also cause enough pressure to burst a blood vessel in the eye. Other causes are high blood pressure, diabetes, trauma or a high dosage of blood thinners, such as aspirin. If a red spot in your eye lasts for longer than a few days, you should schedule an eye exam. Your eye doctor will try to determine the cause of the subconjunctival hemorrhage. Hope it is helpful."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am 56 years old and have had fibromyalgia since the early 1980 s. Over the years I have had lots of joint, tendon and ligament stresses and strains and muscle pain just from everyday things like holding and picking up my children when they were little. It appears that degenerative disc and joint problems run in my family. My mother has now had both hips and knees replaced and several other family members too. I have been told I need a knee replacement in one knee and will be having scope surgery on the other knee tomorrow to repair the meniscus and clear out whatever is floating around in there. What is bothering me the most right now though is I had cortisone injections this past year for tarsal tunnel and other nerve pain caused to the top of my foot from a foot insert that made my shoes too tight. The first injection was in August, and then a second one in November because it seemed they missed the spot on the top of the foot. After the August injection I didn t seem to notice any major side effect, but after the November injection I felt like a hit a wall and had no energy, my muscles felt exhausted and weak, I started having muscle cramps, especially in my calves in the night and pre-waking hours of the morning, for a couple weeks I felt shaky and light-headed, and I also started losing a lot of hair. My primary doctor told me it threw my blood sugars off (I don t have diabetes) and she did blood work and said everything else was fine other than low vitamin D levels. I was referred to an endocrinologist and told the same thing. I was told it would probably take 2-3 months for me to feel back to normal again. I ve been taking vitamin D supplements and a multivitamin with minerals consistently for 6 months now and I don t feel much better, the night time muscle cramping and hair loss has stopped, but I feel totally exhausted and my muscles feel weak and the leg muscles seem to contract and not release, especially in back of the upper leg and behind the knees and the overall joint and muscle pains throughout my body have increased. I can t stand or walk but a few minutes before the muscle cramping and pain kicks in. In the past I experienced hair loss a couple other times, but my doctor and I didn t know why. Now looking back I m sure it was due to the past cortisone injections I had for my knees and I assumed all the other symptoms were due to a fibromyalgia flare-up. I feel like I have aged and turned into my grandmother overnight this past winter. Even my own mother who had both hips and knees replaced moves better and is healthier than me. Is this all due to the cortisone injections? Is the fibromyalgia in hyper speed due to the injections? Could there be some other problem? Will I ever have enough energy and pain relief to get up and go again? I am beginning to think I will need a walker or wheel chair any day now.","Hello cortisone injected intra-articular does not produce systemic side effects elsewhere in the body as it is formulated to remain within joint and doesn't absorb in blood stream to reach elsewhere in body organs or system. Though your mother may look stronger but since you have fibromyalgia, your case is different. Hopefully you consulted endocrinologist and followed his advice thoroughly. See a fibromyalgia specialist who may like to prescribe pregabalin and amytrytaline tabs if necessary to give more symptomatic relief if necessary.Also, methycobalamin tabs may help. Do not worry, take fresh juices and nutritious diet and take physical therapy exercises.It's a difficult disease but there can be ways to improve quality of life, that is by practicing meditation and spiritual practices also and taking life easy. Mental happiness has proved to have benefited several fibromyalgia patients in some unknown ways. Probably, endorphins chemicals in brain which interpret pains and aches are regulated with meditation practices, and scientifically reduce pain perception or increase pain tolerance and thereby quality of lifebelt wishes"

U can have problem of cervical spondylitis or cervical disc problem like compression or prolapse more on the left side, due to which your problem has more radiating pain on the left side. These things can aggravate more due to hypertension and diabetes. Pis check out with a MRI cervical spine and shoulder joint, Irregular pulse rate can be due to the same reason or due to hidden thyroid problems also.pls continue with regular medications can start with pregabalin/gabapentin added with methylcobalamine. Take care. Good luck"
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My 80 year old mother was experiencing a chronic cough that has gotten worse and is worse when she lies down at night. She also has shortness of breath, chest pain and back pain. All symptoms are getting progressively worse. Instead of her primary starting a workup other than general lab work, he has chosen to send her directly to a cardiothoracic surgeon without doing even a chest X-ray. She is relatively healthy, has hypertension and type 2 diabetes and is overweight. Any reason why her doc would choose this path. She is a non-smoker but grew up in a bar and around passive smoke. We are really concerned that he is looking for lung cancer?be",Hello rearward welcome to Chat Doctor.come have evaluated your query in details .* The chronic cough and shortness of breath at 80 must be first evaluated for emphysema or obstructive lung disease with x-ray chest and other supportive data rather than jumping to cardiothoracic surgeon.* It does not indicate lung cancer at all.

Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I carefully passed through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to different causes: - thyroid dysfunction - a neurological disorder (like Parkinson, essential tremor, a cerebellar lesion, etc.)- epilepsy seizures. For this reason, I would recommend performing thyroid hormone levels and a brain MRI. If the tremor is episodic and lasts for a few seconds or minutes, I would recommend performing an EEG to exclude seizures. Hope you will find this answers helpful! Kind regards, "
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",a person of interest claims overactive bladder or underactive is caused by kidneys. I suggested she cut down on liquids during late evening might be helpful. She also feels the kidneys cause diarrhea and constipation also causes the problem with the kidneys. no diabetes. 78 years,"Hi, Thanks for writing in. An overactive bladder is usually due to the muscles at the bladder mouth, though anxiety and the autonomic nervous system in the kidneys can give rise to an overactive bladder. Though kidney function is not directly connected to diarrhea and constipation, it is possible that decreased water intake can cause constipation. However, taking slightly larger amounts of water and fluids will never cause diarrhea. Studies have reported that natural changes in the urinary tract may account for some apparent increase in lower urinary tract symptoms with increasing age. The sensation of bladder filling is reduced, and bladder capacity falls, leading to an older person having less time to respond to the call to urinate and perhaps explaining why many older people complain of severe urge."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Condition has gotten significantly worse, when I sit on toilet, I am afraid I will fall due to numbness in legs and feet , especially left leg and foot . I have to hold on to something for support to walk or crawl when I first get up. If not, I have to physically pick my leg up and move it while supporting myself on whatever is near. This last about 3-5 minutes, but making me afraid of falling. Don t want to have to Crawl.","Numbness in the legs and feet could be because of a peripheral nerve problem (nerves of feet). Short-duration numbness after sitting is common and is not worrisome. However, if numbness persists for longer duration or if it occurs without any pressure on the affected area, a nerve disease should be excluded. You should see a neurologist, who might perform a nerve conduction studies (NCV) test. In addition, he may also check blood tests for diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency and thyroid.

Pain attacks or stiffness occurs when this capsule thickens and tightens around the shoulder joint, restricting its movement. Doctors aren't sure why this happens to some people, although its more likely to occur in people who have diabetes or those who recently had to immobilize their shoulder for a long period, such as after surgery or an arm fracture. In my opinion physiotherapy, yoga, hot commendations with topical gels is helpful, Advil, acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, rest is recommended it may take sometime. In some cases if persists you may ask your physician for imaging and physical examination for the best evaluation for proper x-rays, MRI, other investigations like RBS, urinalysis, SUA, RH factor, and ASCOT title.

Ligamentum flavum thickening ia seen at D10-D11 & D11-D12 levels without significant cord copression. Now he is suffering from severe unbareble pain. He can not walk without walker. He is 72 years old with diabetes (at the age of 40) controlled with insulin ( last15 years). My question is does he need fusion surgeory ? or there is other alternative treatment? He is taking pain killers and went for physiotherapy also. what is the risk factor for this surgeory?","Thanks for the query. Back pain may be due to disc degeneration. Where is the location? Also, It's important to know the level of the painful disc. You can not go on fusing the spine without knowing the exact pain source. Also, he is long-standing diabetic, and it can cause this pain. Initially try to control pain with medicine (Anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxants and if required pregabalin) and physiotherapy modalities such as IT, manual therapy. I doubt about the need for the fusion surgery. I would suggest getting him examined by a spine specialist. Also, sometimes if we can pinpoint the pain generator then we can give him local injection blocks. Thanks."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I am 43 years of  age. I had suffered from Bronchial Asthma since the age of 10 years. I used to have severe attacks and during that period I was dependent on steroid and antibiotics ( or made dependent should I say) for around six- seven years of intense asthmatic attacks. Slowly and gradually the frequency of attacks became less and dependence on steroids also became less. These days I have to take salbutamol inhaler and a medicine called Telekast L. After procrastinating for quite some time and after consulting doctors I married at the age of 38. Unfortunately after two years of short marraige my wife also expired.My questions pertain to my sex life and the problems I am facing. For the most part I had suppressed my sexual needs and often resorted to masturbation.I noticed that I suffered and continue to suffer from premature ejaculation and after ejaculation there is pain in my testicle sac and at the root of the penis. The erection is also not strong enough.Moreover I also feel absolute lethargy and get exhausted very quickly. Most of the time I feel sleepy. With increasing age and a small child to look after I am getting increasingly apprehensive about myself. Many in the family are asking me to go for second marriage so that my child who is only three and a half years can be adequately looked after. But I have my concerns about my sexual potency. Is there any medicine so that the symptoms of overall lethargy and weak libido is taken care of. My future looks absolutely bleak and I seek your urgent advice  to come out of the present predicament.,"Hello, and welcome to Chat Doctor! You mention a few separate issues in your question.  The premature ejaculation is typically psychological in nature, so it is likely that a sex therapist may be helpful.  As far as the pain in your penis and scrotum, I would recommend being examined by a doctor, as this could represent an infection or an anatomic abnormality requiring surgery to correct.  Your fatigue and poor libido could be caused by a number of things, including low testosterone, poor physical condition, sedentary lifestyle, other medical problems (such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and others), just to name a few.  This should be evaluated by a doctor as well. I wish you good health, and thank you for posting on Chat Doctor!"

My sugar level is 197 before fast and 298 after two hours of breakfast. Hb 1 Ac was 12%. I was on medication for BP since last 10 years. Though with home remedies I am able to bring down fasting sugar to 150 with home remedies. Is new medicine is ok for me,"Hi, Based on the history you seem to have uncontrolled diabetes for which your doctor has prescribed Halves Met. Halves Met is a combination of two anti-diabetic medicines Metformin & Vildagliptin.  Metformin works by lowering glucose production in the liver, delaying glucose absorption from intestines and increasing the bodies sensitivity to insulin.  Whereas Vildagliptin works by increasing the release of insulin from the pancreas this reduces both fasting and postmeal sugar levels. Together, Halves Met provides better control of blood sugar. Generally it is well tolerated by most patients however it may cause abdominal cramps, diarrhea, metallic taste and sometimes decreased blood sugar level.  These side effects usually subside over a period of time. Continue taking Halves Met and have regular follow-up lab tests as advised by your doctor. Hope I have answered your query.

Usually liver enlargement may indicate some types of hepatitis or fatty liver diseases and in most cases it doesn't require any specific treatment.  If this is caused by diet, obesity and diabetes then dietary and lifestyle changes will be beneficial in every case. Alcohol and viral hepatitis are the most common causes and in this case medical evaluation is required.

His depression mood swings have increased over the last two years, hes become disinterested in intimacy, he lacks drive and is always tired.  He refuses to take any natural supplements to improve the situation.  He was also diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes which he has managed to reverse with cutting sugar out of his diet altogether.  We cant go on living like this.","Thanks for contacting ChatDoctorI am sorry to hear that your husband is having problems with depression and erectile dysfunction. These two problems go together. As long as he feels depressed he is not wanting to be engaged with any sexual intimacy. He needs to get control of his depression first before he can feel better. I recommend that he be seen by his doctor and have him screened for low testosterone. A low testosterone level is very common in men with diabetes and this could also be at the root of his problem. If he is not having low testosterone I then recommend for him, I recommend either Elena or Wellbutrin.

Dear Doctor can it be cure permanently. Can his body will start generating Insulin in future. Regrads, Thanks.","Hi! Im sorry to hear that about your son. Juvenile Diabetes or what we call as type 1 Diabetes is when the cells that produce insulin are destroyed.  Insulin is needed to help move the glucose or the sugar inside the cells for it to function well. So treatment for Juvenile diabetes is basically Insulin. Many patients with this kind of illness can still live a healthy life as long as the blood sugar levels are within the normal range. Your doctor will advise you to monitor blood sugar regularly. There are insulin pens that are easier and more convenient to use. You can also ask your doctor about it. It will be a big adjustment to you and your family, but it will get easier in time.

Welcome to Chat Doctor!

Been to many different specialists including a study at Brigham/Womens, Boston. Finally found a younger MD, whom Im relieved to progress my issues with. My question is, had a rt kidney biopsy a week ago today, she said the preliminary patChatDoctore back with a lot of scarring of the tissues. Just to continue on wait and watch. I also have a complex cyst on that same kidney, that warranted an MRI but, cancelled due to lab work. What does the scarring suggest? Does that mean stage 5 or renal failure is rt. around the corner? What suggested sites should I be searching? Ty","Welcome to Chat Doctor dear. Thanks for the question. I would like to answer your question in two parts 1. Explanation of physical findings on biopsy -You may already know that each kidney contains about a million tiny filters (called nephrons). We all have damage to these filters after the age of 40 years due to normal aging process. Some of us have excess damage due to various different conditions (diabetes, high blood pressure, genetic kidney disease, etc.) The scarring (this is the term we use to explain to common man) that was seen on your kidney (I suspect it most likely means filters) is the end result of longstanding damage due to any cause. So, the scarring tells us that there is no active disease to treat now. The complex cyst in the kidney may/ may not be related to the general ongoing slow damage to your kidney and MRI is the right way to assess any complex cyst.2. Functional status of your kidney -The staging (Chronic Kidney Disease stage 1 to 5) is based on blood test (creatinine and EFR) and might not tally well with the physical findings of kidneys on scan or biopsy. Your nephrologist will monitor this regularly. Once EFR goes below 15 we class patients as CKD stage 5. Dialysis or transplant usually become necessary when EFR goes below 10. Hope the above clarifies your doubts."

I suggest you not to worry much. The tingling sensation could be due to diabetes or varicose veins. But in those cases, the sensation should have been present almost every time. Another possibility is ""could be nothing"". Just a sensation. Try massaging the area with sesame oil twice a day and most of the cases should be relieved of the symptoms.

I appreciate your concern for the preventive measures for scabies. Scabies is a highly contagious disease caused by mites. Persons with crusted scabies are infested with very large numbers of mites; therefore risk of transmission is very high both from brief skin-to-skin contact and from contact with items such as bedding, clothing, furniture, rugs, carpeting, floors, and other famines that can become contaminated with skin scales and crusts shed by a person with crusted scabies. You must also avoid famines like towels, hand kerchief, tissue, sharing same food containers or glass of water, juice or alcohol with the persons having scabies. Hope these suggestions could be useful to you in preventing yourself from the possible transmission of the mites responsible for causing scabies. Take care of your health."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi. I am a thirty year old female. am a thirty year old female. I was diagnosed with primary hypertension at age 25. My average reading at diagnosis was 145/110, with peak reading at 185/120. In the past few years, my blood pressure readings have averaged out to slightly above normal with medications, averaging 125/95. However, yesterday I had a higher reading of 150/105 and earlier tonight my blood pressure spiked to 140/115 but has now dropped back down to 135/90. I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at age 25 with a fasting blood sugar of 385. Now my blood sugar is in close to normal levels and is treated with Metformin and diet. My A1C is also in normal ranges. I was diagnosed with high cholesterol at age 26. At diagnosis, my total cholesterol was 310. Now it is down to 210 with medication and diet. At diagnois, my LDL cholesterol was 220 and has now dropped to 135 with medications. At diagnosis my HDL cholesterol was 75 and has now risen to 90 with my total cholesterol level being 210 at my last appointment with my cardiologist which was two weeks ago. I have been obese for most of my life and have been unable to lose much weight even with diet and exercise. At my heaviest, I weighed 285 pounds and am now down to 245 pounds which is about 110 pounds overweight. I take Metformin, Benicar, and Vytorin. Last night, I felt naseous and had waves of slight pain and pressure in my chest. I also felt pain in my jawline and left elbow area, whicChatDoctore and went in waves. I was sweating more than usual and was dizzy, but felt better with rest. Today I went about my normal routine, but felt dizzy when I went on my evening walk and now my left arm is numb. With my history, should I go to the ER just be sure this isn t cardiac related?","Hello, With the history what appears to me that your blood pressure is high of course what appears from the readings. But for now I feel it's not any heart attack for now. If it was then things would haven been complained as different way. As dizziness and sweating can also occur due to low blood glucose levels. Now coming back to the fluctuations in the readings. If you are taking the measurement from any of the digital machines, it can show errors too. Having it done on a traditional Blood Pressure apparatus called sphygmomanometer is advised. Next your blood pressure was high, but which arms that you did not mention? Left or the right? Considering the higher on the left or the right the medication will be advised. Coming to your diabetic profile. Usually, due to sedentary lifestyle, people tend to develop the early high blood glucose levels. Taking part in a regular physical activity like exercise should help it under control without having taking medications on a longer run. For high cholesterol levels this has to be taken care with diet more and exercises equally. As cholesterol levels are increased in most cases because the type of food one eats and doesn't burn out leading to high levels. Avoiding oil completely should definitely give the results in reducing the cholesterol levels. Now your next problem is obesity. Now this is something which definitely needs exercise and diet plan. In my clinical practice of 12 years I have seen cases with obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and high blood glucose levels at early ages, but all responded well to diet and exercise well and now all are healthy.  Medicine is of course good but on long run not good for body and especially kidneys. So most doctors advice control of the symptoms mentioned above with diet and exercise. I hope that you start the diet and exercise regime sooner so that you get some excellent results. 30 is not the age to visit medical professionals more often. This is the age to enjoy.

I had a laboratory test of ESR 85mm/Ist hrs, Triglycerides 385mg/dl , HDL 140mg/dl ... What could be the reason for this? And what measures should i take?","HiT hanks for choosing Chat Doctor, gland to answer your query. I have gone through the findings described in your case. Elevated ESR with significant weight loss of about 8 kg in one month duration are highly suggestive of a chronic infection. The possibility of Tuberculosis has to be ruled out. You are advised to visit an orthopedic surgeon to evaluate, and the possible investigations might include X-rays of the chest, lumbar spine, CBC, MRI, etc. The elevated level of Triglycerides can be managed by dietary modifications like avoidance of red meat, oily vegan and non-vegan dishes, increase intake of fruits and green leafy vegetables beside medicines such as Vibrates which are useful in reducing the high triglycerides. Hope your query has been answered. Should you need more information, kindly feel free to send your query. Wishing you best of your health."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am 40 yo. Male. I have been having mild (i stress mild) abdominal discomfort on my right side, but also occasionally left and lower abdomen. It is mostly on the left side but it does not have a specific spot: higher lower, sometimes could be on the back, on the front, just under the ribs, etc. and as I said sometimes is on the left side. No history of cancer in my family, but history of IBS and stress related symptoms. I have diabetes, diagnosed less than a year ago (have had tendency to it since a kid - 5.7 and 5.4 where my last A1C readings from 2 days ago and mid March, respectively; 5.7 was the reading that triggered the glucose intolerance test upon which diabetes was confirmed). Im on 250mg a day of metformin (500mg when I eat more during the weekend). I take enalapril for high blood pressure (which runs in the family). Since starting these medications I have been limiting carbs a lot, eating lots of steamed, boiled vegetables. I have never been eating a lot of meat or fish my whole life. I am a very anxious person and tend to worry about any symptoms. Before feeling this abdominal discomfort I have had symptoms of anxiety attacks (mild chest pain in no specific area, feeling of panic building up, tingling of upper body, arms, etc). Other tests and ECG were negative. The lab work performed 2 days ago showed everything is fine apart from low level of vitamin D (abdominal ECO was negative). My doctor prescribed me vitamin D supplement. Could the abdominal discomfort may be linked to diet and lack of vitamin D. Thanks (sorry for the long posting).","Hi. I understand your concern.I assure you nothing is wrong with you, abdominal discomfort may be due to metformin, it will improve with the time. IBS has low chance. Keep relaxed, enjoy your life.

Repeat your HB1Ac after 3 months, hope it will be in normal range if you have such struck diet control. I hope I gave your answer, i will be happy to help you further. Thanks for using Chat Doctor "

I have a red, growing, cauliflower like growth that hurts if it is bumped on both the 1st & 3rd joints of my right index finger.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",my 92 year old mom is in the hospital with a virus or infection waiting to be diagnosed. They did an electrocardiagram or echo gram ? and said her heart is pumping at 35% . She has been told in the past many years ago that she has had a heart attack though she is not aware of this. Could her 35% reading be due to something that long ago?,"Hi, In your mothers case the heart pumping of 35% (which is evaluated by doing echocardiography as Left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF) is mostly likely to be due to old heart attack which she is not aware of. In heart attack some part of muscles of heart (myocardium of left ventricle) get permanently damaged due to lack of blood supply to that part of heart. This damage depends upon time duration of symptoms of heart attack and treatment received, and also on type of treatment received. Some patients do not aware of symptoms of heart attack or neglect it and miss the symptoms as in your mothers case (this happens more in diabetic patients), these patient do not receive medical attention and due to lack of medications there is likely possibility of further deterioration of heart function (pumping).  Though there are other possible causes of decreased heart pumping like infection, high blood pressure, diabetes in these case there is possibility of improved heart pumping after treatment. As you have been told that your mother had heart attack in the past by your doctor, this consideration must be based on echocardiography report. So there is really less chance of improvement in heart pumping in your mother, but we can definitely try to maintain current heart pumping by appropriate treatment. We can do following for your mother (depending on her current infection, her physical activity and tolerance)1) To start her on blood thinning medicine (antiplatelet)2) Control her blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol if problem present.3) Coronary angiography which will tell about degree and number of blockages in different blood vessels of heart depending on which we can plan further management.4) Start her on diuretics, b blockers, ACE/Arms, only if tolerated in current scenario."

I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 6 months ago. I took the med for a month but was able to control the BGL with diet and exercise. In Sept, I started to react (miled, prolonged itching in face on arms or hands) to carbs and a few other foods (kidney beans, wild rice, white potatoes, ritz crackers, yogurt, vinegar) and meds (statins, cardura, miralax, colace, losartan, nitroglycerin .02%). That has me a avoiding anything with these products in them. That means I have a hard time with needed meds and I have very few foods I can eat. I have lost 55 lbs in those 6 month and need to find a way to eat enough carbs to level off my weight... Can discontinuation of or taking Tradjenta cause people with a history of food (cinnamon, nectarines, cayenne, wheat bread [drowsiness]) and chemical allergies/intolerances ( lexapro , neurontin , biaxin , penicillin) to develop a slew of other allergies that fast--all in September?

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am 59, and recently had surgery to remove a very large lipoma from my back. The surgery was done in an operating room due to the large size of the lipoma. I have a severe allergy to latex - type 1 IgE mediated with anaphylaxis, and strict latex precautions were in place. I also have severe asthma secondary to the latex allergy. I do have diabetes - type 2 insulin dependant, and I am post graves disease. I was intebated. When I was extabated, I had trouble breathing. The Anesth gave me an updraft of epinepherine, and I turned blue, and my O2 sat dropped to 70%. The epi was stoped and I recovered, but had severe chest pain. I was admitted and had the chest pain again the following morning. Evidently I showed an atypical rise in my Troponin T levels, with a negative CKMB. I also had some EKG changes. I was transferred to the large medical center, and was evaluated quite extensively - all was negative (stress echo, nuclear stress, )no angiogram was done. I was on a nitro drip and also on heparin IV. Nothing showed except this elevated troponin t level, and they discharged me without a real diagnosis after 24 hours. What do you think happened to me? Could it be related to my latex allergy? ? histamine release?? My tryptase level was 18.5 Could I be allergic to epinepherine? I also showed some fluid around the heart - ? why?","Hi, Troponin level could be raised because of lots of conditions including severe anaphylaxis, post-surgery apart from cardiac disease.  But an ECG change along with raised Troponin level is highly suspicious of cardiac disease (blockage in arteries of the heart) and also you had the chest pain. Plus you are a Diabetic. I could not think of anything other than a cardiac-related problem. We do not recommend doing a stress echo in patients with positive Troponin, dynamic ECG change and with chest pain. I will advise you to see another cardiologist and get an Angiography done soon. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "

Please see that borderline kidney function with diabetes should be taken seriously. You should have disclosed your blood urea and serum creatinine level.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","i had a few surgerys and lately i have been getting lots of abd pain... i had a ct scan done to check for hernias or tumors since i had them quite a few times and had them removed. Dr told me that you can see adhesions on the ct scan.... i have diabetes and im a little worried, because he stated that he would have to do another surgery so that the abd pain can get relieved. is that true that you cant see the adhesions on the ct scan?","Hi. The adhesions can be seen on the CT Scan if they are well-formed. The secondary effects of adhesions in the form of intestinal obstruction with proximal dilated bowel loops can be nicely seen. Diabetes has to be under control and well managed for the best outcome of any treatment. I would suggest to under Enterocytes as it is better than CT scan and Ultrasonography to see the intestinal obstruction, kinking and so on. You may then definitely go for the next surgery as advised to you. Internal hernia can also give the similar symptoms but will be different on CT or Enterocolitis."

Usually liver enlargement may indicate some types of hepatitis or fatty liver diseases and in most cases it doesn't require any specific treatment.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi Doctors! my brother 52 years old had been diagnosed with prostate cancer 4 weeks ago and had all tests done and MRI bone scan and was told it is inoperable and will have to have hormone replacement and radiation treatment and today was told he had two black sports on the hip bone and more MRI on Friday and the results next Thursday. He had been told he has type 2 diabetes and he is on blood pressure tablets for a very long time and also has high cholesterol and on tablets for that. His weight is around the 85 mark and is about 5.7 in height. Born in South Africa, Chinese mum and German dad and been living in Australia for 37 years. I would like to know what the outcome would be when the MRI is positive that the cancer had spread to the bone....how soon would they start the treatment and how severe will it be... He had previously done all test on his prostate and nothing showed up and suddenly when diabetes was detected he was sent for prostate cancer test. Please Advise... thanks Selinah.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Prostate cancer can spread to hip bones and lower back in many patients. Since they are evaluating disease spread, it is best to get the MRI done and then start with treatment within about 15 days. As stage 4 prostate is inoperable, it is best to give radiation and hormone replacement and guide treatment progress regularly. As he is diabetes, he should not get any infection during or after radiation treatment and care should be taken. The radiation treatment is usually given in fractions. It can be 15 days or 20 days with or without breaks. The cancer will be exposed to a medical dose of radiation each session over days. Most people do well after radiation treatment though his general health must be closely watched during and after radiation treatment. Please do not worry."

What causes this infection? What are treatment options?","Gallstones are solid accumulations of the components of bile, which occur when the components of bile are not in correct proportion to each other. A gallstone blocking the outlet from the gallbladder usually causes acute gall bladder infection, so that bile cannot get out. The bile can become concentrated and infected, causing the condition. Chronic gall bladder infection occurs when the gallbladder walls have become permanently damaged by repeated attacks of acute gall bladder infection. Rare causes of gall bladder include severe burns or injury, massive systemic infection, severe illness, diabetes, obstruction by a tumor of the duct leaving the gallbladder, and certain uncommon infections of the gallbladder including bacteria and worms. To treatment includes removing the gallbladder, either immediately after diagnosis or after the patient has improved. Occasionally, patients witChatDoctorplications require surgery immediately after diagnosis. Patients who have infection with no gallstones have about a fifty percent chance of death if the gallbladder is not quickly removed. If the patient has other serious medical problems that may increase the risks of gallbladder removal surgery, the surgeon may decide to leave the gallbladder in place.  In this case, an operation called a cholecystostomy may be performed to remove obstructing gallstones and Chat Doctor. "

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","hello doc,my mother 49 yrs of age is suffering from pyleo nephritis..she has been suggested antibiotic treatment..but the response in improvement is really slow..she does not like to eat,n feels nausea all the time..wat should be the correct medication.she has diabetes and hypertension also","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Pyelonephritis is the infection of the kidney and upper urinary pathway. This requires a longer course of antibiotics than usual. Partially treating pyelonephritis will cause the disease to not get eradicated and lead to antibiotic resistance. In the case of your mother it is suggested that she gets a urine culture and sensitivity test done. This will tell which antibiotics are required to eradicate the bacteria causing the pyelonephritis. The culture and sensitivity test will show which antibiotic will work the maximum and give relief in a short time. Having diabetes makes treatment difficult and this is probably the reason why she is taking longer to recover. If she does not like to eat then her diet is to be modified to include healthy food which can be given like fluids and juices. HY Chat Doctor. "

Invokana contains Canagliflozin and Foreign contain Dapagliflozin both are of same class of antipathetic medicine SGLT2 inhibitor.

While excreting glucose there may be loss of water and some essential electrolytes like sodium, potassium through urine which may be responsible for leg cramps.

I am freaking out, and have no time to see a doctor due to finals. What could this be?","Hi and thanks for being part of our virtual clinic! I understand your concern can give you some advice:1. Skin boils are caused by bacteria. Whether from infection or from a clogged hair follicle, they can occur anywhere on the body and are usually painful2. Within a day or two, the bump or bumps begin to fill with pus. Boils continue to grow over several days or weeks, with more and more pus accumulating inside. 3. Boils can appear almost anywhere on the skin. They occur more often on hairy parts of the body, where the infection may begin in a hair follicle.4. Poor hygiene and poor general health are risk factors for skin boils. People with diabetes, which can interfere with the bodies ability to fight infection, or with other immune-suppressing conditions, are also at risk. Skin problems like acne or eczema can make it easier for the bacteria to get in.5. Keep the area clean, but don't scrub or pick at it. Doing so can make the infection worse. A home treatment that may help is a warm compress. Warm compresses may help the boil rupture more quickly. To make a compress, soak a washcloth in warm (not boiling) water and place it over the boil. 6. You can use Bactrian cream and ointment both contain the active ingredient mupirocin, which is an antibacterial medicine In case of getting worse, contact your doctor and write us against the best!"

It is less likely that this is related to the medications and I would not ignore his symptoms.  With his history of high blood sugars and hypertension, it sounds like he also has diabetes which is why he is on Amaral.  Your dad is going to need a few tests including labs to check his kidney function and an ultrasound of the kidney area and a urine culture to rule out an infection.  I think the best way to do this would be to go the primary doctor again and tell him or her the new symptoms.  I hope this is helpful to you,"
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am experiencing sharp, shooting pain down my neck across shoulder/ shoulder blade. Occasionally, my right hand fingers will go numb. I drop things i am holding without knowing and couple times i did minor injury to fingers. If pressure applied to elbow, my shoulder blade get sharp pains in it. If i turn my head either way i get pain down my right arm. And if looking down for a period of time, it is ver difficult to move back up to see straight ahead. I can lift up to 10 pounds before pain will occur. I am able to lift 20 pounds for about 20 feet before pain is so bad, I have to stop or lose feeling in arm. What is/ can be the cause of this??","Hi, In my opinion it is a sort of neurovascular injury of your median nerve or neurovascular compression of cervical spinal nerves. Your symptoms are showing Carpal Tunnel Syn Chat Doctor.  The main symptoms are pain, numbness, and tingling, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring fingers. Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. Pain may extend up the arm. Weak grip strength may occur and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. In more than half of cases both sides are affected. Risk factors include obesity, repetitive wrist work, pregnancy, and rheumatoid arthritis. There is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. It is unclear if diabetes plays a role. The use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. Types of work that are associated include computer work, work with vibrating tools, and work that requires a strong grip. Diagnosis is suspected based on signs, symptoms, and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests. If muscle wasting at the base of the thumb is present, the diagnosis is likely. Being physically active can decrease the risk of developing CTS. Symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections. Taking NSAIDs or gabapentin does not appear to be useful. Surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non-surgical options. Further, splinting after surgery is not needed. Evidence does not support magnet therapy. Hope the above information helps you. Any further clarifications feel free to ask."

I assume that it relaxed the esophageal sphincter to the point that it was not containing stomach contents in a lying down position. Is there another recommended treatment for getting rid of the stones? I have a doctor s appointment in two weeks and want to be prepared with my options.","Hi there, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Obesity, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol are some risk factors for gallstones. So you need to reduce weight if you are obese. You need to check your blood glucose and cholesterol levels. If these are high, medications are to be taken to control their blood levels. These measures would to some extent prevent the development of new gallstones. You can also take UCA (USO delay Colic acid) which to some extent may prevent development of new gallstones. As far as the gallstones that are already present, they are large stones and there are no medications to dissolve large stones. The only definitive treatment for large stones is surgery.

I have had to put her in a nursing home, but I do not think this is doing her any good at all. We have tried to get her in local neurologists in the area. We have changed doctors that since this first neurologist had seen her. He has now left the country, and none of the neurologist around here. We will see in a of his patient. What can I do, I am lost. We really did not get a true diagnosis because hardly any test, and the CAT scan and the CT scan, other than blood","I read your question carefully, and I am sorry about the situation you are in. It is difficult to make recommendations on treatment though because I am not sure if she has Alzheimer's. Dementia can have many causes, Alzheimer's is the most common, but there are other possibilities to be excluded such as vascular dementia (repeated strokes), vitamin B12 deficiency, low thyroid function, Parkinson's disease just to name some common ones. The fact she manifested symptoms at only 56 is a red flag to consider a diagnosis other than Alzheimer's as it typically occurs later. The tremor you describe is also not typical for Parkinson, makes stroke, Parkinsonism syn Chat Doctor. So the way to go is to check what blood tests has she exactly done, have thyroid function and vitamin B12 level been included. Also while a CT might serve to exclude some issues, generally an MRI is a recommended exam as it gives more info on the atrophied sites or old lesions which could orient the diagnosis. A neurological exam also is needed, although I understand the difficulties you are encountering in finding a neurologist, she should be evaluated for Parkinsonism or other neurological signs as well as have some neuropsychological tests to determine what areas of cognition have been more affected. I hope things work out for the best."

The first part refers to remains of some old injury, sort of like small scars, not active anymore and hard to assess the origin, an infection in the past, or narrowing of small blood vessels leading to minor injury due to lack of blood flow. If over 65 the latter is more likely, should pay attention to factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etc. which make you prone to more damage to blood vessels in the future. As for the microhemorrhage it's a small bleeding in the brain.

Now what medication is advisable. Is insulin must or can be controlled with medications.kindly suggest.,"Hi, After going through your mothers case, I would like to advise you - Insulin is definitely the one of the best option for her because 1) She recently has undergone PTC to RCA (angioplasty). If indication for PTC was recent heart attack then insulin is the best option with her blood sugar levels of 300 & 400.2) She is already on 3 different types of Medicine for diabetes and on that her blood sugar levels were 170-220. In that case beside use of insulin alone or in combination with oral medicine, only few options are available which may be costlier, and we cannot assure better sugar control with them. 3) Use of different types of oral medicine in her case also depends on her kidney, heart status (which can be known from her serum creatinine level and left ventricular ejection fraction on 2DEcho) Metformin is avoided in case of Deranged serum creatinine and low ejection fraction. Glipizide is avoided with high serum creatinine level. Pioglitazone is avoided in case of signs water retention in body like breathlessness, swelling over legs, significant weight gain. Chances of water retention increases with deranged kidney function, low LVEF.  Pioglitazone also avoided in old female due to increased risk of osteoporosis fractures. I would also like to advise 1) screening for other diabetic complications like nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, foot examination.2) strict compliance with her medications (for diabetes and for heart problem - blood thinners, Beta blockers, ACE/Arms, Statins as advised by cardiologist) and diet.3) Regular BP check4) keep cholesterol under control (use of statins). Keeping all this fact into consideration use of insulin (for which high degree of motivation is important) is highly recommended in her along with oral medications depending on her reports after consulting with your doctor.

Based on your query, my opinion is1. The lumps on your abdomen in epigastric region are probably just subcutaneous fatty tissue being prominent or lipoma. 2. Your weight is on the higher side, which is causing this.3. Chest and abdominal discomfort is due to gastritis or HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disorder) as the gastroesophageal reflux will be more in obese individuals causing chest pain/ discomfort.4. Do not lie down immediately after having food. Try to reduce weight as obesity is the cause of most of your problems and in the long term it can lead to hypertension/ diabetes/ cardiovascular diseases.5.

I have read carefully and analyzed your concern. I understand you are worried about that some problems might inherit to your children. Let me assure you there is no harm to your marriage, if you are a diabetic or what blood group you have.  Regarding your child Chat Doctor. If you are a woman with type 1 diabetes and your child was born before you were 25, your children risk is 1 in 25; if your child was born after you turned 25, your children risk is 1 in 100. If both you and your partner have type 1 diabetes, the risk is between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4. In general, if you have type 2 diabetes, the risk of your child getting diabetes is 1 in 7 if you were diagnosed before age 50 and 1 in 13 if you were diagnosed after age 50. Some scientists believe that a children risk is greater when the parent with type 2 diabetes is the mother. If both you and your partner have type 2 diabetes, your children risk is about 1 in 2.

My Grandfather on my Dads side was diagnosed with hypoglycemia and my Grandfather on my Moms side was diabetic. Should I be concerned about the spikes or where it regulates itself??,"Hello, Thanks for the query. I have seen the details. My suggestion is got an oral glucose tolerance test (OG TT) done. That will give a clear indication about whether you have any problem with blood glucose. Secondly if persistently low glucose levels are seen and are causing any problem it is better to get your C-peptide level to see if there is any excess insulin. Another important point in a normal person even when one eats any sank blood glucose level does not go above 140 mg. So if it's going beyond that (200 mg) then it appears to be presence of diabetes.  Therefore, please get an OG TT done. Thanks."

I can understand your situation and problem. I think she is having fluid retention in the body due to low urine output because of kidney failure and diabetes. Fluid retention in body causes1. Edema feet2. Pulmonary edema (fluid in lungs)3. Ascites (fluid in peritoneal cavity)So breathlessness can be due to pulmonary edema. And more in night favors pulmonary edema more. So better to admit her. She needs diuretics and treatment for kidney failure, cardiac problem, diabetes etc. So consult doctor and discuss all these."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Yes, I have had Type 2 diabetes for over ten years... take pills - no insulin but lately I have been extremely thirsty and I urinate more than I ever have.... I also have had 3 yeast infections since Dec. 2016 (I am a 61 year old divorced woman- no sexual activity) and wondered if this is a result of my Diabetes?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have read your question completely and understand your concerns. Excessive thirst, frequent urination and fungal infections can all occur in a diabetic patient if their blood glucose is not well controlled. For good diabetes control, fasting blood glucose should be less than 110, 2 hour post radial should be less than 160-170 and HbA1C which is there 3-month average blood glucose should be around 6.5-7% (depending on the age, and any other medical complications). You could get the above blood tests done and consult your doctor. If your blood glucose is in the normal, you still need to see your doctor to rule out other causes of your symptoms. I hope this answer has helped you Thank your Regards Chat Doctor. "

He does enjoy his whiskeys on weekends and wine on some days.. His liver function tests have shown high GGT values.. The doctor has advised udiliv 300 mg, 1 tablet at night for 3 months. Does this medication have any side effects? Is this medication safe to have along with statins? Thank you","HelloSign GGTP is due to the increased intake of alcohol. Although ADÍLIO has many side effects like nausea, vomiting,diarrhea, joint pains etc. and should not be taken along with statins, its role in reduction of GGTP is very doubtful.ADÍLIO is basically used in treatment of gall stones. The best treatment for reduction of over enzymes caused by alcohol intake is1... Complete abstinence from alcohol2... Regular exercises3... Consumption of fresh fruits and green vegetables4. Avoidance of junk food and controlling of sugar levels if you have diabetes. Thanks"

Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern, and would explain that these symptoms could be related to different causes: - sexual hormone changes due to menopause-autonomic neuropathy related to diabetes. I would recommend you to closely monitor her blood pressure in sitting and standing up position. A head up tilt test would be necessary to examine for possible orthostatic hypotension which is a part of autonomic neuropathy. A nerve conduction study would also help investigate for diabetic neuropathy. I would recommend avoiding eating in large meals and eating frequently during the day in small meals. Avoiding hypercaloric food would also help avoid these symptoms. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, "

Otherwise I m fit and am still working in an Engg Firm. Advise me ways to control this allergic deficiency and to reduce eosnophlia count. YYYY@YYYY 0000 Bangalore","Hello, Reading your query and the results of the blood tests, I presume that the percentage of eosinophil count is 10% that has several causes. The commonest cause in tropical countries is parasite infections, and antiparasitic treatment is recommended after stool culture studies. This is a must before going through unnecessary tests or treatments. If the eosinophil count remains high and sneezing and rhinoconjuncitivitis symptoms persist, it would suggest allergies as the underlying cause. Pollen allergy, smoke (industrial) are major factors that need high dose antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. The duration of treatment will depend on the trigger (i.e., seasonal vs perennial [all year around]). There are several other causes but infections, allergies and rarely autoimmune diseases are causes of raised eosinophil counts. I also hope you have recognized red flags such as significant loss in weight and appetite that should be taken more seriously. I hope this was useful. Best Wishes."

A 28-year-old with physical limitation unusual for him. The probability of coronary heart disease is low but not zero and the treadmill provides useful information. It lets you know that his limitation is not severe and risk of near term death is not high affording time for deliberation, elective evaluation and choices in the next step for arriving at a diagnosis.2. The ECG is abnormal in D3 (frontal plane lead III) with exercise but rapidly returns to normal. This is frequently a false positive finding and does not automatically indicate arterial disease.3. The treating physicians are sufficiently suspicious to recommend invasive testing. Oddly, one of the most difficult things to test in medicine but also one of the most important, is the physicians' suspicion after interview and examination. Therefore, the recommendation to look for additional information should be followed. The options that should be discussed with the treating doctor (to be sure that he or she has the information needed to make good decisions) are 1. Additional physiological testing performed with imaging methods such as nuclear imaging or echocardiography.  2. Non-invasive angiography using CT scanning."

You are known to have severe diabetes and chronic alcoholic since many years facing problem of loss of libido and erectile dysfunction since a couple of years. This is due to following reasons 1) Uncontrolled diabetes resulting into Diabetic Neuritis which involves nerve involved in process of erection 2) Diabetic vasculitis causing loss of elasticity of arterioles in erectile tissue of penis .3) Diabetic atherosclerosis causing narrowing of blood vessels (Penile Artery) carried oxygenated blood to erectile tissue resulting in to reduced blood flow to erectile tissue. Consult qualified Urologist for clinical evaluation and get following basic tests done to establish cause of your ED 1) Blood tests for sugar to see status of Diabetes2) Blood Tests for Free and Total Serum Testosterone levels 2) Color Doppler Ultrasound Scanning of penis to rule out /confirm vasculogenic cause for your ED, Further treatment will depend upon results of these tests and cause of your ED.

Family History: Father Diabetes - Types 2 Mother: Thyroid, BP, Diabetes type-2","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause. You are at higher risk for cardiac cause. The reasons are1. High cholesterol. More chances of coronary artery diseases.2. Family history of DM type 2 in both mother and father. So chances of diabetes in you are high. And diabetes is a great risk factor for heart disease.3. Family history of hypertension in mother. Hypertension can cause cardiac muscle damage and thus cause cardiac disease. So I advise you to get done ECG, 2D ECHO, cholesterol levels and sugar levels."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi doctor. I am Amardeep Dhamija from India. I have been having my son (age: 18yrs) treated for persistent back ache for 1 year and 4 months now. The problem was diagnosed as arising from low Vitamin D levels ( 2.80) and Vitamin B12 (below 83) levels on 02Dec 2011. He was given ARACHITOL shots and also put on D-gain. I showed him subsequently to an endocrinologist who had a liver test done (SGOT: 14) and (SGPT:14) , Serum Bilirubin (1.37) and Conjugated Bilirubin (0.52) on 18 Dec 2011. Thereafter, I took him to a very senior orthopaedic surgeon who put him on Calcium and Vitamin B12 supplements . Ever since, he has been taking them. His latest tests done on 21 Feb 2013 show Vitamin D 46.40, B12:699 , Calcium 10.00, SGOT: 34 and SGPT:69. Related to this or not, my son also was suffering from Nausea, vomitting etc for which he was prescribed antacids by an endocrinologist. These symptoms have alleviated somewhat. Query: Sorry for the lengthy background but is SGPT level of 69 something to worrry about. I should also like to mention that he is in the final year of school and preparing for exams and is under considerable stress as are other kids like him. Lifestyle: sedantary for about 2 years. Please advise regarding his liver condition and generally what he should do. His back ache is considerably reduced and is only intermittent (normaly when he sits for prolonged hours). Thanks.","Hello, Although the most common cause for high levels of SGPT is generally due to consumption of alcohol but since he is a student, I am ruling this reason out. The other apparent cause in your son could be prolonged use of painkillers which he might have taken for his persistent backache. Other reasons could be obesity, high triglyceride levels in blood or even diabetes. I advise you to get his lipid profile done. Since there is no particular for its cure, I advise following things regular exercisesStop taking any pain killersTake fresh fruits and green vegetablesAvoid junk foods like pizzas, burgers,noodles etc. and colas. Reduce weight and be in required range of BMI. Get his SGPT repeated after 3 months and if you still find it high, then consult a gastroenterologist and get tested for hepatitis markers and other relevant tests. Thanks"

Recently diagnosed with diabetes. I am 74 yr old woman.,"Hello, I have gone through your question and understand your concern. Arachnoid cysts are common findings in MRI and considered incidental, generally not responsible for any symptoms at all. The tremor you are having is probably an essential type of tremor and not related to the arachnoid cyst, nor does the depression have anything to do with it. Thus, the arachnoid cyst does not need any treatment. Hope this answers your question, I wish you good health."

The following conclusions can be considered based on the ultrasound report you have furnished. 1. Placenta lying anteriorly is perfectly fine and showing early grade 3 maturity is considered to be normal at this stage of pregnancy. 2. Amniotic fluid is adequate and AFI (Amniotic fluid index) between 8 - 18 is considered normal. 3. Fetal weight of 1.7 kg is fine as it needs to weigh normally 4 pounds (1.8 kg) at 32 weeks of pregnancy.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have a molar tooth that will need to be extracted. It has decayed to where half the tooth is damaged/chipped. My question is I have gained a lot of weight even though I work out and track calories and have had lots of light headedness. Could these symptoms be connected with the tooth?,"Hello, I can understand your concern. Tooth decay is never associated with weight changes and lightheadedness. Tooth decay can be associated with food impaction in the tooth, sensitivity to hot and cold food, pain during chewing, at night or all the time and referred pain can be felt in ear or temple. Other than these, other symptoms are not associated with the decayed tooth and should be checked by a physician for other diagnosis related to hormonal system and blood pressure. I would recommend consulting a physician before tooth extraction as lightheadedness due to blood pressure changes can cause complications during extraction and hormonal issues such as thyroid and diabetes should also be cleared or kept under control with medications, if present, before extraction. If the tooth causes pain by the time other issues are solved, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Motorola 10 mg up to thrice a day for pain relief. Do not do heat compressions or hot/warm water gargles. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,"

The surgeon found torn tissue wrapped around my spine and it was leaking fluid. I had been having headaches. I have been having muscle spasms in both legs and pain. There has been numbness in my feet and burning sensation. This has been going on for three months. The surgeon had a Nerve Conduction Study done and the results are Peripheral Neuropathy and Sural Nerve damage. He told me no physical therapy which I don t understand why not. I m going to ask him. What do you recommend? Thank you! I m hoping to make an appointment with a neurosurgeon or Neurologist.","Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern. It is a bit unusual to report these problems after a spinal stenosis surgery. Anyway, at this point you have peripheral neuropathy which is mainly seen in diabetes, and probably you had it before surgery. Another cause is intoxication generally by Chat Doctor.  In this case Gabapentin and amitriptyline would help a lot on nerve repair and relief from numbness. While rural nerve damage can cause burning sensation but other than that it is not very concerning because it is a sensory nerve and does not cause weakness or major problems. As for the burning sensation gabapentin and amitriptyline are recommended. Hope this helps."

I can understand your concern. Left sided chest pain in patient with diabetes and hypothyroidism should be evaluated for heart diseases. So first get done ECG, 2d echo and stress test. If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Musculoskeletal pain can be the cause because you are having pain on rib cage movement (coughing, sneezing).

Minor bleeding from gums while cleaning teeth can occur sometimes. However, if you are having regular bleeding problem, it can be due to various reasons. If its due to local gum disease, after cleaning maintain good hygiene. Use soft toothbrush with a toothpaste containing tannin acid. Do warm saline rinses, gum massage. Take vitamin C, healthy diet including citrus fruits, carrot, spinach, etc. Bleeding should stop in 2-3weeks. If it persists, go for further investigations like blood test for anemia, clotting factors, diabetes, etc. Genetics can also be a reason. Hope the answer helps you. Thank you."

Thanks Linda","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Foot Infection is difficult to manage because of its weight-bearing chances of getting repeated injury & soiling. Usually it starts with a trauma or abrasion or puncture wound, skin involvements like edematous lesion, misfitting shoes. These get secondarily infected to form inflammation, ulcers, getting deep in the skin, soft tissue, may be sometimes up to the bones. You seem to have an ulcerative circular lesion with scaling of skin on your foot. Looking at its chronic standing I would like you to exclude few conditions-Diabetes-In diabetes due to raised blood sugar, infections do not respond to routine treatment. You should get your fasting & post meal blood & urine sugar tested & in case it is raised-consult a Planetologist for further investigations & specific treatment. A controlled blood sugar along with proper management of infection will heal completely. Peripheral vascular disease-This causes narrowing of peripheral blood vessels & condition needs to be excluded, as it causes chronic infections, more so in lower limb. The diagnosis is made by USG-Doppler, angiography, computerized Tomography. Please consult a surgeon for his expert advise For management of the wound as well as peripheral vascular disease. A detailed CBC, HBO & culture & sensitivity of the exudate from the infection site are usually done to define the exact causative organism & the sensitive antibiotic, medicine will be selected. Local management of the infection ulcer with proper cleaning, removal of dead tissue & application of healing agent is to be followed regularly till complete healing. This should be done under expert surgeons care. Wearing of proper shoes/socks to protect foot from further injury of new healing tissue should be followed after the treatment. Thank you."

I do drink a light beer every now and then.should I stop drinking a beer every now and then.I am on snytroid and my numbers were fine.what foods should I eat for my kidneys .,"Hello, Low kidney function (also called CKD or chronic kidney disease) means that, the filtering capability of your kidneys might have become low. You must definitely be surprised about it, since you don't have symptoms, and that's why it is called as silent disease. Your doctor must have checked up your creatine levels in blood and albumin levels in your urine. They must be some borderline high and that is the reason, your doctor is wanting to repeat the test in another few months so that kidney functions can be monitored and seen whether they have decorated any further or not. Any deterioration in kidney function would have to be taken seriously as CKD is a progressive disease which means that it can get worse over time. People with family history of kidney diseases and having high blood pressure and diabetes are called as high risk people. A prompt and early detection can help prevent the progression of kidney disease to kidney failure. Since your triglycerides are high, your doctor has rightly advised you to take aspirin. You must also start doing exercises and avoid consuming beer. Reduce your weight also. As far as food for kidney is concerned, nothing specific is to be done at the moment. Keep your thyroid status in check. Thanks"

I certanly eat less then usual, as I am afraid of getting the atack. Thank you in advance AAAA","Hello, Yes. The gall stones can result in weight loss. Repeated attacks of pain associated with vomiting result in less appetite and also the fear of attack makes you eat less. Eating less results in a sustained weight loss over time.However, you must get your sugar levels checked as uncontrolled diabetes may also result in gradual weight loss. You must consult a surgeon and opt for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This shall get rid you of your gall stones as well as your symptoms. Thanks"

In my opinion, we should first rule out diabetes and dyslipidemia because both these can cause poor control of blood pressure. So get done sugar level and lipid profile.

Im good floser, and keep my dental visits regular, every 6 months.  On my last check up - there was nothing wrong, but a week ago, I started to have a swollen gum from the inside of tooth #8.  It bleeds in the morning and I could see puss coming out when the gum is pressed.  I never had anything like it before, please advise!Diana",Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Bleeding and puss discharge associated with the tissue surrounding the implant suggests inflammation in the gums and presence of an abscess. If untreated can lead to destruction of the implant bone connection leading to the problems in the implant. Medical conditions like diabetes and smoking habit will further worsen the condition. I would advise you to visit your dentist and have it reviewed. The inflammation and infection will usually be cleaned in the affected area and if needed antibiotics will be prescribed. Maintain a good oral hygiene. Have your implant routinely checked. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards.

Once a person has been infected with herpes 1 and/or 2, then recurrent infections can occur because these viruses live in the system. If your immune system is suppressed (not working well) for some reasons then the infections would occur more commonly e.g. if you have diabetes, on steroids or other meds that affect the immune system, You can check to see if there are any reasons that may be affecting your immunity and causing the frequent infections.

His blood pressure also is not very bad. However, he clearly has kidney failure and must get dialysis if he is to survive. Peritoneal dialysis may be an option for you. This kind of dialysis can be done at home. First he must have a catheter placed in the abdomen to use for the dialysis. I also assume the Hg 9.1 is his hemoglobin, which is low. This is common with kidney failure. He may benefit from iron supplementation. He should already be seeing a kidney specialist. If not, please have him see one to discuss peritoneal dialysis at home, iron infusion (and ongoing supplements), as well as safe medications that can be used in kidney failure patients to treat depression. Fluoxetine may be a good option for him to help with the mood. However, starting dialysis and eliminating toxins may also help improve the depression.  Good luck."

This has just stared. I feel like there is something wrong as I dont feel generally well all the  time. Just like a blah yuck feeling. I am female and 38.","Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor The tingling sensation that you are experiencing is likely neuropathy. This refers to abnormal structure or function of the nerves.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, My name is Denise Gold. I was wondering what could be wrong with me. I am 16 years old, I m 123 pounds, breast cancer and diabetes run in my family, I m mildly active ( I walk about 2-3 miles about 3-4 times a week, medium pace). About 4-5 weeks ago I was 134 pounds, but now I m only 123.. I m not an expert, but I m sure 11 pounds lost in 4-5 weeks isn t okay. I eat the same as I ever did, so it couldn t be change in diet . Also, my gums have been really weak lately. They never would bleed for me when I would brush my teeth , but now when I brush my teeth i can spit out dark blood, and at random times they would just start bleeding . I brush my teeth on a regular bases, my Mom s a health freak. Another thing is I ve been extremely hungry lately, more than I usually ever am, but when I eat I feel sick. I don t think it would be pregnancy because I just got a really heavy period, mind you it was a whole week early and only lasted 2 days (my normal periods are usually ALWAYS the same time or very close to the same time every month, never a week off, and they would always last a minimum of 4 days. Also, my breasts have been getting really sharp pains at least a few times a day, especially in my left one near the midline of my body. Another thing is, I swear I ve been so mean lately, naturally I can be mean sometimes, but never like this. I just feel like it s something I can t control. Another thing, I m in a career tech. school and I m going for allied health. Well, my class was practicing vital signs and my teacher was demonstrating on me with the radial pulse . She pointed out that my pulse was extremely slow for my age. Also, I ve been having a lot of bowel movements for the past couple weeks, more than I usually do.","Hi. From your history I understand that you are quite obese and have been having weight loss, with recent onset of bleeding gums and a low pulse rate. I'm not sure on how low did you mean your pulse rate is, though I guess if you do not have any fainting attacks or chest discomfort due to this, you need not worry. Weight loss despite normal diet, may be an indication of the onset of diabetes, or may be due to thyroid dysfunction which may also have abnormal bowel movements. Bleeding gums can not be tied up with these two conditions, though bleeding gums is a very common problem. It could be that your gums are unhealthy with infection, or you have scurvy, or you have some other condition associated with weight loss which can be picked up after a detailed evaluation of you and your blood counts. So please consult a physician for the same. Thank you."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, Im 36 with a 20yr history of smoking, and diabetes type 2 and moderately overweight. I was going up and down the stairs and got some mild chest discomfort. It went away, and have not experienced it again. I went to a scheduled routine appointment with my PCP who did an ekg and found some nonspecific changes and sent me to the hospital. The ekgs were negative and they ruled me out for an MI, then went to a cardiologist and told me eventhough the ekg is neg. he think im having unstable angina and said i need an emergent cath based on my risk factors and one episode of chest discomfort a week prior, he said he does not trust a stress test as it can kill me with unstable angina. I have not experience the pain ever since, and im afraid he may be jumping the gun with a cath....I am concerned that he also a stent happy type of guy. I tried to find possible alternatives such as 64 CTA, but he says I may die if I wait and have to have the angiogram. I know cath is the gold standard, but cta has a comparable negative predictive value. Other studies such as a conventional pulmonary angiogram is the gold standard to rule out pulmonary embolism, but nowadays a pulmonary angiogram is almost never ordered to exclude a pulmonary emboli.   Am I being unreasonable to consider alternatives or is a cath is absolutely needed STAT?","Hello, Brief Answer: Considering the risk factors and clinical condition, you may have ischemic heart disease. Explanation: My opinion is that you have a complaint which is chest pain with effort. With other risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. A long history of smoking is a major risk. I suggest my patients the following EKG, routine laboratories such as Complete blood count, lipid profile and located hemoglobin to check for blood sugar control. Then other investigations as echocardiogram and stress tests may be needed accordingly. Conclusion: I suggest you start on anti-ischemic then CT coronary angiogram is not a bad choice at all if that comforts you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

Been dealing with alot of issues for six months consisting of heart palps , irregular rythem, dizzy/lightheadness not vertigo, change in bowels. My doc says its all anxeity related. Recently I found out I have vericocele no pain though. My blood work shows total Testosterone at 392 and B12 at 315. My doc put me on 2000mcg of B12 for a month but after 2 weeks i noticed i get pain in left arm and tingly fingers in left hand so i stopped taking the B12 pill and it went away, does this show B12 causing me a blood clot? Tommorow morning i go get my total t tested again and the free t also b12 tested again to see if there has been improvement. Sorry for the paragraph i appreciate your time.","Ernie, the B12 is probably a red herring. It probably didn't cause the problem you started with or the arm sensations. When you have the constellation of things that are bothering you, it is reasonable to look for a systemic problem. It sounds as though your doctor has done that and not really found a culprit. Often, the problem is not an illness but a lack of some of the things that we all need to stay healthy. Specifically ask yourself and of your doctor about, Exercise: Exercising every day for 20 minutes should be your goal. Is your body weight excessive. A little can go a long way if it is mostly in your belly where it affects sleep, joints, heart rhythm and when you're older, diabetes and heart disease. Abnormal sleep. Sleep disturbance is often present in people who are overweight, particularly those who snore. If you are very tired in the morning, sleep easily during the day and snore loudly, you may have sleep apnea. It is a common cause of abnormal heart rhythm requiring treatment."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have discoloured teeth that dentists say was caused by tetracycline and currently suffering from bad breath i dont know what to do about it. are these related.,"Hi There, Thanks for posting your query. Bad breath or halitosis is caused to many reasons. It can range from simple things like not Chat Doctor.  Having bad oral hygiene like having tartar which leads to many gum diseases like periodontitis or having decayed tooth also causes bad breath. Systemic disease like diabetes also causes bad breath. You need to see a dentist who will assess your condition and advise treatment accordingly. Discolouration of teeth are of two types, intrinsic[inside] or extrinsic [outside]. Intrinsic stains such as tetracycline or fluoride are not related to bad breath. In order to correct these you can undergo bleaching or whitening of your teeth. Specialized treatment procedures like laminates or crowns may help in masking tough stains. Extrinsic stains are those caused due to tartar, pan chewing, cavities, etc. which can be related to bad breath. You will need to undergo scaling or treatment of the cavities according to the cause of the problem. Hope that answers your query. Thanks,"

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you are having mostly HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). But better to rule out cardiac cause first for your chest pain as you are obese, diabetic and hypertensive. So get done ECG and 2d echo to rule out cardiac cause. If these are normal then no need to worry much for cardiac cause. You are having HERD mostly. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause gaseous feeling, burping and burning chest pain. And depression and obesity worsen the HERD. So better to follow these steps. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food, stress and anxiety. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Start Proton pump inhibitors. 4. Go for walk after meals. Lose weight by exercise and dieting. 5. Consult psychiatrist and start appropriate treatment for depression."

Currently being prescribed a anxiolytic to help him with his hallucinations Also he is on concuction of other medications for diabetes , angina, Parkinson s, pain killers, constipations relief. Thank you","Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your question... From your description, I infer that your uncle is having transient visual hallucinations. Now, Flucloxacillin is not known to cause any hallucinations or psychiatric symptoms.  However, anti-parkinsonian medication are well known to cause psychotic symptoms including hallucinations. The other aspect to consider is that since he is on a cocktail of medication, interactions between medication can occur and this can sometimes lead to erratic levels of a particular Chat Doctor.  Moreover, in elderly persons, who have multiple medical complications and who are on multiple medication, delirium should also be considered as a differential diagnosis. (symptoms of delirium include confusion, disorientation, disturbance in the sleep-wake cycle and hallucinations) As regards the treatment, anxiolytic are not the specific treatment of choice for hallucinations. He may need to be started on anti-psychotics, but again, this has to be on a low dose and given with caution, because anti-psychotics have a risk of worsening his Parkinson's symptoms. I would suggest that you take him for a consultation with a Psychiatrist, who would be able to make a detailed assessment and advice appropriate treatment. All the best. - "

Please tell me what this Sonography report means.","Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor.  I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. This ultrasound shows enlarged liver with coarse nanostructure which is a nonspecific finding, but in some cases it may indicate certain liver disordersThere are many causes of liver enlargement and treatment depends on exact cause. Most common cause is fatty liver. If this is caused by diet, obesity and diabetes then dietary and lifestyle changes will be beneficial in every case. Alcohol and viral hepatitis are the most common causes and in this case medical evaluation is required.Also, if there is infectious disease or biliary duct disorders then you need to do some tests to rule out more serious issues which require specific medical treatment. In every case, if there are high liver markers then CT scan should be done as a next step which will reveal liver condition ore precisely. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I frequently feel dizzy and neasous after short periods of excercise or even for no apparent reason. My feet sometimes tingle. I am always sleepy and can hardly stay awke for 8 hours at a time. I have recently started eating more than usual and I am constantly hungry even after eating large meals. Is there something wrong?,"Hello, Dizziness, nausea, tingling sensation in feet and increased appetite are suggestive of impaired glucose metabolism or even diabetes mellitus. I suggest you get blood glucose levels fasting and postprandial. Fasting glucose levels below 100 mg/DL are normal, between 100-125 suggests impaired glucose tolerance and above 126 mg/DL suggests diabetes mellitus. Postprandial glucose levels (after two hours of having food) below 140 mg/DL is normal, between 141-200 mg/DL is indicative of impaired glucose tolerance and above 200 mg/DL is suggestive of diabetes mellitus. If the test results are abnormal appropriate treatment can be started, and thus the symptoms will relieve. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","kindly i got my right leg swollen and it is paining. i was scratched 2 months ago by a small cat which i bstepped on accidentally and it scratched me on top of the trouser,i ignored but 2 months later the leg  has swollen.i went to hospital yesterday and was given an injection on the vain and supraben 500g which iam now using.The dog said it sclerolis or something like that what is your advice.","Hello. Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. It is unlikely that the current swelling and pain is due to the cat scratch as quite a lot of time has elapsed since then. If it was as a result of the cat scratch, it would have appeared within 1-2 weeks. The current medication you are on, Supreme 500g, if the contents of it were available, it would be more helpful. Right now I can think of the following possibilities:1. A sprain in the right leg - either in near the knee or ankle, which was caused by an injury subtle enough for you to have not noticed it.2. An abnormality of the bone - infection or any malignancy (unlikely if you are more than 30yrs of age) 3. An infection of the skin or cellulitis - likely if you have had any injury or even without an injury especially if you have diabetes, with uncontrolled sugars.4. Varicose veins - if your job involves prolonged standing or are very overweight or have any other condition affecting the valves of the veins of the legs. You need thorough examination of the leg and blood tests like a complete blood count, an HbA1c, random blood sugars - mainly in addition to other usual tests that your doctor may ask for. In addition to this, a venous Doppler or ultrasound of the leg and X-ray if necessary may be required. Hope this helps. Wishing you a speedy recovery. Chat Doctor. "
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am experiencing leg cramps at night ( severe) This only happens at night about 4 times a week. It begins in the shin area. I had ALL ( Lekemia) 5 years ago with chemo at MD Anderson in Houston, TX. I am in remission. I am also a diabetic on insulin. I do take blood pressure if this could be the cause. Is this serious. What type of specialist should I see.","Thank-you user for your query. I understand your concern. As per your query all I want to suggest is that diabetics may develop leg cramps as in diabetes there happens weakness of muscles mostly in legs and forearms. For this you can start taking methylcobalamin 1500 mcg daily, and it should be continued for at least 15 days continuously. You should also start taking calcium in form of tablets daily and vitD3 60,000 IU once weekly. Kindly mention how many units of insulin you are taking. So far as your chemotherapy is concerned 5 years ago, well it may also cause pain in legs as chemotherapy reduces the potassium in body thereby causing leg cramps. For this I should have asked you to consume banana but since you are a diabetic, so I can't ask that. Start having high protein diet in form of soybeans, you may also consume fenugreek seeds as well. If at all pain worsens then tablet of diclofenac potassium can do your work. But you may consult any endocrinologist for your diabetes and any hematologist to check for your All too. God bless"

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, my husband has been suffering from shortness of breath and dizziness for a couple of years and no one has been able to diagnose why. He had 2 bypass open heart surgery late 2011 and was doing good for probably 6 months when the shortness of breath and dizziness started. He also has Type 2 diabetes which is being controlled by medication/metformin and is considered well controlled. He also suffers from anxiety disorder and mild depression which he takes medication for. He looks healthy until he tries to do anything strenuous and becomes short of breath, dizzy and sometimes nauseous. He has had every heart test and lung test available and has been told everything is within normal ranges with just a small amount of emphysema in his lungs but not enough to be causing his condition. He also has arthritis in his neck and hands pretty bad. Any ideas??? He is on numerous medications for high blood pressure, blood thinners, antidepressants, statins for cholesterol and something for his prostate.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your husbands situation and problem. Since his extensive cardiac and Pulmonary work up is normal, possibility of stress and tension related breathlessness is more. Stress, anxiety and depression can cause shortness of breath. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your husbands case and start working on its solution. Counselling sessions are also important along with Chat Doctor.  He is also having emphysema (mild), so prophylactic inhalers containing inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are also helpful to relieve breathlessness.

I am Chat Doctor. You have mentioned pain in your back region with radiation of pain in the legs as well.Also, you have multiple co morbid conditions for which I am sure you are having adequate medical care. As far as your back is concerned, I need to ask you a few questions based upon which I can tell you what further needs to be done :- What was the cause of onset of this pain if you can recall it?- Duration of the back pain ?- Apart from your back pain do you also have any associated radiating leg pain, numbness, weakness in limbs, paresthesia etc. as well?- Any aggravating or relieving factors of your symptoms?- How much distance can you walk, and what are your analgesic requirements on a daily basis?- Is there any history of Fever, Loss of appetite, Weight Loss, Rashes over the body?- What investigations and management has been done till now for your existing problems? I can tell you that lower back pain could be due to many reasons, it can be due to narrowing of your spinal canal, disc issues, bony instability and facet arthropathy etc. But the majority of these conditions actually can be managed conservatively with Posture maintenance, physical therapy and medications. Although I am sure you have tried a lot of medications and alternate form of treatments, but till the time I can see your details, If you have localized back pain with no other neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesia etc., then you can start with following recommendations for initial period of 2-3 weeks:- To maintain proper posture of your back while working and sleeping, try maintaining an erect posture as much as possible- If pain is more than you can take a short course of an anti-inflammatory medications which suits you like Ibuprofen, Paracetamol etc-Physical therapy initially under supervision of a trained physiotherapist.- Adequate calcium & vitamin D intake if levels are low in body-Hot fomentation can be done at home 3-4 times in a day, if possible-Analgesic spray for local application can be used after fomentation - Avoid lifting heavyweight/ acute forward bending in mornings and take adequate precautions till pain completely subsides.etc will observe you for next 2-3 weeks how you respond to this conservative management protocol. If there is no clinical improvement, then we will plan for your investigations including blood tests, X-Rays and if your back pain is a long-standing one, then MRI of lower back region.

Get a Repeat CT scan or MRCP and you may need ERCP and stenting of the pancreatitis duct to relive the sphincter of Odd dysfunction too. This may very well help.

It appears that your blood glucose levels shot up due to the glucocorticoid treatment. This is a common problem we see in Diabetic patients.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My mother(age- 49) has been diagnosed with disc herniation and cervical canal stenosis in C4 to C7 as per her MRI report. She had severe neck & left arm pain also feels a tingling sensation in her left thumb , otherwise her movements & motor reflexes are alright. Does she require a surgery? What are the complications of the surgery? What if we don t go for surgery? Can this be treated with medication?","HAI,1. Disc herniation with cervical canal stenosis is basically a mechanical issue which cannot be treated with medication. Medications can only improve your symptom / pain or may be numbness to a part, but cannot get back the herniated disc.2. Since she had developed tingling sensation in her left thumb → nerve compression by the herniated disc.3. Not all cases of herniated disc +/- nerve compression require surgery. Give a trial of cervical traction and see whether her numbness improves. If she is not benefited by traction, then surgery is the only way to get rid of the numbness.4. Surgical complications can range from none to immediate postop blood collection inside canal. Risks are always involved in all surgeries (simple to more complicated) that we have to accept - ranging from infection to technical difficulties with added co-morbid conditions of the patient themselves (age, wound healing, bone quality, diabetes / heart disease/ hypertension / thyroid or metabolic diseases etc.). Better surgical techniques with use of microscope has decreased sucChatDoctorplications. So operating on cervical spine now-a-days with good ICU care is becoming a routine."

An abdominal ultrasound and a Chest X-ray might be very useful in making things clear and guiding further evaluations. Other specific markers of liver lesions like Alpha photo proteins, gamma amino boutique acid and 5 Nucleotide exams, shall be asked based on these preliminary results.

That happens on many levels. First, be sure that high blood pressure is not secondary to any other diseases as Cushing or renal failure. Then, Diet with low salt and less fat content is crucial. Exercise and other healthy activities are also a mean to control blood pressure. If all that does not help, medications are a must. That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities. Some Chat Doctor. Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started. I suggest my patients the following : know how to measure your blood pressure accurately, avoid coffee or stress before readings. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about other comorbidities like diabetes, hyperlipidemia. Also height and gender is important. *Conclusion: I suggest you home blood pressure measurement. If all or most of the readings are high you need start controlling it.

People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called blood sugar, which in turn causes chemical changes in nerves and damages the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the nerves. Over time, high blood glucose can damage the vagus nerve. Treatment includes medication, dietary changes."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My daughter, age 35 had an x-ray of her lungs last Friday. It was ordered at the physicians office and the film was there within minutes. We looked at the pics and there was a white haze over the one done where we could see the lungs straight on. There there was a side view, with a large mass of solid white at the lower end of the lung. The doctor was concerned but didn t say anything other than we will wait for the radiologist to read. She has a hard time breathing and can t get to physical because she almost loses consciousness . I believe she has diabetes and we are checking for this as well. She did have cancer and she has masses of tumors in her abdomen area which are being checked out now, through testing. Her eyes sometimes feel that they are going to shake out of her head mostly when she wakes up. She gets the shakes so bad she can t function and the doctors never check her for diabetes. I was wondering if the cloudy haze on the lung area could be COPD or Cancer. If there s a white mass at the lower end of the picture (not see through) what could that be? SORRY, I CAN T GO THROUGH WITH THIS AS I DON T HAVE ALOT OF $$$ AND I THOUGHT THE CONVERSATION WAS AN OPEN FORUM...SORRY.","It is not right for nonmedical persons to interpret X-rays on their own. In the curriculum of medicine especially for radiologists X-rays are the most difficult to read and must be interpreted cautiously. Wrong to give opinion on your description of white patches on chest X-ray. Anyway from the history you have provided, since must be having lung infection of spread of disease to lungs from abdomen. These two are the primary possibilities and treatment needs to be done accordingly. It would be better if you stop thinking of all this concentrate on her treatment"

It s been a week now and I ve only seen one normal fast. I think im taking the pill too early at night and maybe it wears off before I wake. Im thinking to take anotger 1.5mg at 4am since i wake at 7am and take my blood sugar. What do you think?,"Hi, Sorry to know that your sugar levels are not coming down around normal levels despite taking glyceride. In my opinion, the dose of glyceride should have been increased especially as you've not been on any other oral hypoglycemic or an insulin. It is important to bring your sugar level to around normal levels as being pregnant you are a high risk case. One week time is sufficient to bring down your sugar to around normal levels. Please do not change the medicine timings on your own. Talk to your doctor for a review. I hope my answer helps. Please feel free to ask a follow-up question if there is any confusion.

I have it bilateral L5S1 myotomes and I have significant reduction of the peroneal nerve action potentials bilaterally most likely is from severe axonal loss at the L5 root level, what does this mean?","Chronic enervation of the nerve is loss of myelin covering of the nerves which helps in conduction of impulse along the nerves. There are various reasons both acute and chronic. Acute is injury to the nerve and the most common chronic cause is nutritional and destruction of nerve due to pressure over the nerve root seen in spondylosis and chronic disease like diabetes and inflammatory lesions like leprosy, polio. So we have to find the cause of enervation in your case and treat it accordingly."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My mother is 63 years old and suffering from Chronic Liver Parenchymal Disease with swollen portal vein and Ascites fluid. All the symptoms match like swollen legs & feet, continuous coughing and problem of short breathing. As doctor say, she is in her third stage of said disease. Recently the ascites fluid was drained out and it was about 2.5 litres. The sme was analysed and one of the report revealed her protein to be 2.5, RBC as +; WBC-800 & lymphocytes to be 100%. Would like to understand what this disease is and how far her liver is functioning. Her health is deteriorating day by day and she is loosing weight. We would like to know in which direction her treatment should start..rather what is the next step and probable medicines to be given.","Hello, Unfortunately Chronic liver disease is not a curable condition. It can arise due to various reasons like prolonged diabetes, viral hepatitis, certain alternate medications etc. In CLD the liver functions are compromised.  The protein albumin decreases and pressure in the portal vein increases (as the liver gets shrunk). This leads to fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) and swollen legs (edema).  Fluid overload in the body and ascites can cause breathing difficulties. It is important to check the ascites fluid as it may get infected, and an antibiotic course is needed in that cases.  There is no specific treatment for CLD. The mainstay of therapy is supportive like prevention of constipation (by lactulose syrup), prevention of bleeding (by vitamin K injection), Chat Doctor.  The liver function tests (including INR) and complete blood counts need to be monitored. Your Gastroenterologist may plan for an endoscopy to check for a venous swelling in the esophagus. You just need to monitor for some dangerous signs like confusion, severe abdominal swelling, black stool, bleeding from any site. I can just advise to reduce the salt intake in the diet and fluid restriction (depending on urine output). The medical therapy needs to be discussed with your gastroenterologist in details. The only definitive therapy availability for a decompensated chronic liver disease is a liver transplant, which I am sure your doctor must have explained about (the risks and benefits involved). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care "

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Toward the end of the day and in bed I get pain in y left foot or ankle much like described on TV for persons with diabetes yet I do not have or ever have had that illness but I have had vascular surgery to improve circulation. The pain feels like numerous pins sticking me. Cause?,"This needs a vascular surgeon to evaluate and treat. It seems like you may have peripheral vascular disease affecting your arteries-the arteries bring blood flow from heart to extremities- when you lay down, your legs elevate from the dependent position and the blood flow slows to your extremities. At the end of the day your leg may swell from venous insufficiency and that may further compress the arteries."

And just yesterday I have developed an ear infection, which I get frequently. Can these be related and if so what could it be?","Dear patient your symptoms of tingling in leg and ear infections makes me to suspect diabetes. For which you should get your glucose testing done.

Just a sense of overwhelming or pressure. my arms have been aching and hurting some; as well as my hims and legs at times. Diabetes and heart disease are in my family. I felt really bad one day and checked my sugar with my father s meter 2 hours aftet eating. My blood sugar reading was 140. But i have checked it before eating lunch the past days and it was 79 and 78. I have checked my bp at home also. It has been readings such as 134/99, 140/101, 123/90, 134/96..and elevated other times too. I ve been checking it several times the past few days. What should i think and do? I had already made an appointment with a new medical doctor for march 31 to get established. I called back but the receptionist said he had no openings before that date. And if i needed attention before to go to a local clinic. I am making it but i just don t feel well. Should i be more concerned or fine to keep waiting till my appointment?","Hello! I carefully passed through your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to any cardiac disorders. The muscular pain could be related to a viral infection or electrolyte imbalance. This does not seem to be an emergent situation, and you can wait until your doctor consultation. I would recommend performing some tests: - complete blood count-muscular enzymes- PCR, sedimentation test for inflammation- liver and kidney function tests-blood electrolytesRegarding your blood pressure values, I would recommend to closely monitor your blood pressure different times during the day (in sitting position, after 10 minutes of total relax), write them down and show them to your new doctor. The values you refer are within the normal ranges, and some of them are borderline. This means that you do not need to start antihypertensive therapy. Some lifestyle modifications would be enough to help you maintain a normal blood pressure: - a healthy diet (low salt and caffeine intake)- a lot of physical activity (aerobics, walking, jogging, recreational sports, etc.)- reduce your weight if you are overweight. Considering your blood sugar levels, they are within the normal ranges and do not indicate diabetes. So do not worry about them! Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards!"

It is very simple to solve if you can logically reason it out. Unfortunately you cannot do it since your unconscious mind refuses to accept it. If you can see a Hypnotherapist and explain this, he will solve it for you. Anyway, I am going to help you by the following message. Every one born in this world begins with birth and ends with death. The duration of the life is dependent on the lifestyle you live. A healthy environment will usually give you a long life. Aging is also a process which can be controlled to a certain extent by your habits and lifestyle. One who has healthy habits, does regular exercise. Eats healthy food, avoids all intoxicants like alcohol, smoking and chewing tobacco will be able to delay the process of aging but cannot avoid it. Someone in your family or friends must have died prematurely and that may be due to some common disease like diabetes, or heart attack or cancer and this must have affected you. So don't worry, you follow the instructions given by me, and you will live along and healthy life."

That is why proper control of hypertension, as well as screening for diabetes for control, will help prevent early onset of kidney disease.  In general, a target blood pressure of less than 120/80 is optimal and would lower the risk of kidney disease due to hypertension.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I am diabetic and on Metformin, and am wondering if this could be the cause of the sensation of ice water running through my entire body.

As you have T2 diabetes, if this condition is there for a long time (months or years) or sometimes even in the beginning there may be peripheral neuropathy developing.  The sensation described could be due to that manifestation. Metformin can occasionally cause stomach disturbance, but no other major side effects. It is essential to achieve a strict blood glucose control in diabetes to be free from all the symptoms. Fasting should be closer to 100 mg, PP 160 to 170 mg & HbA1c%<7.

After going through your question, I can understand your concern. Left side chest pain radiating to left shoulder and arm (as in your case, it was present in last month) is most likely related to heart. Chest pain associated with deep breathing or cough may be related to respiratory system. In your case you need evaluation for heart disease.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. Don't worry, it is nothing serious. According to your explanations your husband had a qua triple bypass and as I see he is all sow hypertensive and diabetic. I have to explain to you that in this category of a patient our goal is to maintain the heart pressure between 110-120 mmHg, because of ischemic heart disease and diabetes. So a heart pressure between 110 mmHg is quite normal, it is our goal. It is normal that if it's just the beginning of this values it will take a little time to adapt. He might feel dizziness but you should not worry. It will pass. Only if you catch lower blood pressure values, below 100/60 mmHg every day, we might consider reducing any antihypertensive agent.

If I boil and drink it. my question is, how much dose should I drink? Also, I am on TRESIBA for diabetes. I am also on LISINOPRINE for blood pressure as well. Is it safe to use BLACK SEED while I am these medications?","Hello, I understand your concern. While black seed is widely used as a cure for many ailments, its interactions with most medications have not yet been fully studied. Black seed (Nigeria sativa) is known to lower blood pressure, so combining it with Lisinopril is something to be tested extremely carefully first. I suggest that as you continue taking your recommended dose of Lisinopril, you should keep track of your blood pressure measuring. If the measurements you get are not satisfactory, then you can try and add very low amounts (like half a teacup per day) of the boiled black seed and see if and how much it affects your blood pressure. Keeping a diary with all the BP measurements for easier comparison is a good way to do this. And of course, making amends to your diet, exercise regime and lifestyle is quintessential.

Burning sensation in the legs can be caused by peripheral neuropathy which means pain or burning sensation due to damage to nerves of the legs. In smokers the arteries of the legs below the knee tend to develop plaques causing pain on walking and burning sensation. To evaluate that you have to do a bilateral lower limb arterial Doppler.

In terms of the pain I'm going to give you this link to look into because I've sent this information now to several of my patients who are in chronic pain for other reasons, and it is an interesting concept that may develop into something you could benefit from since you're so young. It's called the Orphaned/Anesthesia global project.  Also, KFS can be approached surgically in such cases if pain and immobility of the neck or if scoliosis became so painful or obstructive to daily activities that other measures simply don't function. Scoliosis can be corrected if you have that problem and again, you're young, so I believe your healing capacity is going to be excellent assuming you don't have any significant comorbid metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. I think that with the right therapy program and support groups by your side you stand actually a much better chance at a very good quality of life that may not be completely full of chronic pain as you might think.

Sincerely grateful, Maria","Hi, Thanks for posting your query. I am Chat Doctor. The only definitive treatment for multiple gallstones is surgery. If it is not causing any symptoms you can leave it as such. But if it causes cholecystitis, then it has to be removed. It can be removed laparoscopically. A histopathological exam would say whether the possible mass is malignant or not. Simple fatty liver is harmless. But over a period of years/decades it can cause serious issues.

The last blood test I had about a month ago-everything came back within range.  Please advise, K","Hi, Flank pain is a relatively common condition that can have a lot of possible etiologies and a number are commonly seen in urology. Anyway I want to say that this is not a sign of diabetic kidney disease because or diabetic nephropathy do not cause pain. So, don't worry. In diabetic nephropathy the filters of the kidneys, the glomeruli, become damaged. Because of this the kidneys leak abnormal amounts of protein from the blood into the urine. This is the main sign that the kidney is starting to fail. Possible causes of your dull right flank pain can be urinary tract infections like Cystitis or pyelonephritis or renal calculi. I suggest consulting a urologist to investigate about your flank pain (urine test, blood test, ultrasound etc.) and if you find the cause, you can have the right treatment.

There is no need to get worried if your tests for all STDs are negative. It can be a fungal infection or mild bacterial infection. A fungal cream usually takes a week or two weeks of application to show any visible change, but the itching disappears in 2 to 3 days. The other possibility is a mild infection of the foreskin (if uncircumcised) or the glans. This might require a short course of antibiotics. Many times color changes in the tip of penis without any symptoms can be a normal occurrence. A dermatologist will confirm your condition and give you more specific treatment. Please maintain genital hygiene and wear cotton inner clothes if you sweat a lot."

How long a stent lasts?- my husband is only 55yeras; does a stent lasts in good condition atleast 25 years. What are the status of the people (and the stent)who underwent stent placements in 1986-90. (2) In my husband s case: As the leg pain still continues was th epain due to any other reason. - some thing to do with nervous system. He has from childhood - hand shakes when he holds straight like a glass of water.,"Hi, 1st of all we generally do not recommend placement of stent if the blockage is below 70%.  The stent remains good for lifelong if he takes a proper blood thinner, has well-controlled diabetes or does not smoke tobacco. Leg pain is not related to it and should be because of some other cause. You should get an arterial Doppler done of the bilateral lower limb and also see a neurologist for the same. Regardless of the year of putting the stent patients remain good if the conditions I have stated are fine. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

This year s physical my blood sugar level was 6.2 fasting and 7.1 after glucose tolerance test. According to my doctor a have diabetes. Is it possible that having that terrifying experience could have caused it? and is it diabetes for sure or is that borderline?","A 5 is great. A sugar level of 6.2 fasting puts you in the pre-diabetes range. You could be carrying a diabetes gene and that experience turned your gene on, we can only guess. You do need to take appropriate measures to lower it a bit. Take a look at your diet and get rid of junk, add healthy fruits/veggies/whole grains (especially OATS), good fats (virgin olive oil, etc) and exercise. Now, on the other hand your 7.1 you received after the 2 hour OG TT would have been closer to 7.8 for prediabetes. Ask him to do a HbA1C to cut the tie. If you do have red, you want to nip it in the bud!!! A HbA1C should be 5.7 (optimally) to 6.4% A HBA1C of 6.5% is diagnostic of Diabetes. And, ask him specifically why he thinks 7.1 is prediabetic?? He is probably translating it into blood sugar for fasting instead of looking at the cutoffs for a 75 g OG TT test. If he is confused have him refer to the January 2015 Diabetes Care issues on the new Standards of Diabetes Medical Management. It is good for you to question the discrepancies, but in the end, ask yourself if you are being given warning signs? The HbA1C should give you further information. Good luck.

Im 24 years old, 55 in height and 130lbs in the family of my mother they a a diabetic history.","Hi, I had gone through your query and understand your concern. Please do not worry thinking about diabetes transmission. Since diabetes is not a blood-borne disease, there is no chance of developing diabetes due to needle prick injury. Diabetes is hormonal disorder mediated by impaired insulin action. In case of type 2 diabetes, the probability of developing diabetes increases to those who have positive family history.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My wife is 59 years old and will be 60 years old in March of this year.She us about 5 2 in height and weighs 70 kilograms (154 pounds)She was previously diagnosed as having a fatty liver.She was prescribed Zocor (simvastatin and/or silymarin) which she takes every other day.Recently, her blood test shows the fact:1) ALT/ GPT Blood - 62 with the range being IU/L 33 2) AST/GOT Blood - 41 with the range being IU/L 32 Query: Should we be concerned that there may be something wrong aside from a fatty liver? Would you recommend more tests I.e. Abdominal ultrasound? Sample of her liver tissue to be taken for biopsy? EtcThank you very much!John","Hello! I have been through your question. Related your concern I think that you should know that the elevated levels of ALT/AST is moderate, and usually fatty liver is the most common cause of unexplained persistent elevation of liver enzyme levels after hepatitis and other chronic liver diseases have been excluded. The good news is that fatty liver is a reversible condition that can be resolved with changed behaviors and often has no symptoms and typically does not cause permanent damage. But when fatty liver is caused by an underlying condition, it can become harmful to the liver if the cause is not recognized and treated. The most common cause of fatty liver is alcoholism and other common causes obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes some medications. You should know that potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, stenosis, and cirrhosis. So what I suggest for your wife in this situation is doing a physical examination by a hepatologist, exclude viral hepatitis (lab test Bag and anti HCV), abdominal ultrasound to see the local situation of your fatty liver and to exclude cirrhosis and lipidograme. Furthermore, a liver biopsy definitively allows excluding alternate causes of elevated liver enzymes, and it is the only method to distinguish (in certainty) non-alcoholic fatty liver from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and it provides information on the stage of the disease. But it belongs the hepatologist, based on your data to decide to do or not a liver biopsy because as all invasive procedures exist some risks. I hope my answer help you."

White matter disease has different mechanisms from multiple sclerosis.

She has been in the hospital since sunday and on meds and it went from 2.5 to 3.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Creatinine is a protein which is excreted by kidneys. It is actually a waste product Fromm bodies metabolism. Normal level of creatinine in blood is up to 1.5. When this level rises, it means that kidney is not excreting creatinine out of the body. This is commonly seen with Renal (kidney) failure. Most common cause for Renal failure are diabetes and hypertension. Since your grandmother is having both, diabetes and hypertension, possibility of Renal failure due to these diseases is more. When kidney fails to perform its functions, urine output decreases, so there is fluid accumulate in the body.

He uses a walker now and was told that he has damage to the nerves in his brain that control his movement. This came on extremely fast and a few of us think that his wife may be slowly poisoning him. It takes him about 10 minutes to shuffle 10 feet. Do you know of a poison that would slowly but surely take his mobility away? We are very concerned.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. It might not be any poison causing his symptoms. There are many conditions that affect the brain and the symptoms start suddenly. It will help to talk to his doctor and get a brain scan done for him. There might be conditions like Parkinson's and dementia which can cause gait changes and abnormal mentation in a person who is elderly. Understanding his condition from the clinical perspective might help in guiding his treatment and slowing the progress of disease.

Thanks for posting your query. Too much masturbation can't cause any detrimental effects to your penis and doesn't really lead to a decrease in the size of the penis. However, it can make you extremely fatigued and lead to a premature ejaculation. If you're healthy, without any chronic medical disorder, for example, diabetes, you don't have to be worried about the size. Its better you avoid any sexual activity or masturbation for a couple of weeks and then look for improvement. If it is still not getting resolved, you need to get a health check up to find out if anything is wrong with you. Hope that answers your query. Regards"

It may be noted that he is going to toilet alone with the support of the nurse and closes the door behind and opens by himself! Also, I may note that he is 46 years and is diabetes ... Thanks,","Hello, Im very sorry to hear about your friends stroke. Here is some information relation to hemorrhagic strokes (brain bleeds).First, brain bleeds can happen for different reasons such as a head injury (traumatic), a rupture of an aneurysm and bleed within the brain matter itself (parenchymal hemorrhage). It is very important in your friends' case to determine what caused his bleed. Given his fevers any infections need to be ruled out and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) should be done to rule out any sort of infection of the heart valves which could send bacteria to the brain which could result in a bleed. He absolutely needs to have blood vessel imaging in the form of either a CT angiogram and MR angiogram to make sure that there are no abnormal collections of blood vessels in the brain and aneurysms that could have cause the bleed. Also, when there is a bleed in the brain a tumor must also be ruled out. All that being said, the most common cause of a bleed in the brain is due to high blood pressure which causes weakening of blood vessels and can result in a hemorrhage. Most commonly management of brain hemorrhages is supportive, meaning that the only things that are done is blood pressure control, pain management and if the person is unconscious then support for breathing. If the bleed is very large then surgical intervention may be necessary. What the doctors are saying as that they want to repeat a CT scan to see if the bleed has become larger, which can sometimes happen. There are several risk factors for the bleed worsening: one is poor blood pressure control, another is if there is an underlying aneurysm or blood vessel that could bleed. That's why it is so important to determine what caused the bleed. For small bleeds with no underlying vascular or malignant pathology the outcome is typically fairly good. The blood causes irritation and pressure on the surrounding brain causing weakness and neurological symptoms, but as the blood subsides the symptoms improve and sometimes there may be a remarkable improvement. The language area of the brain is very delicate, and it is hard to predict how well he will recover, but my best educated guess is that he will recover at least some language function and could even recover close to how he was though probably never quite back to level his language was before the bleed. It sounds like he is doing relatively well overall since he is able to go to the restroom without support, so that is an encouraging sign. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

Would you please clarify a few things for me? 1)how old are you - above 40yrs? Are you overweight? Are you male? 2)do you smoke? Any history of heart disease, diabetes hypertension, hyperlipidemia? 3)any family history of heart disease? 4)have you had any surgeries or injury to your chest, shoulder or neck? 5)sedentary lifestyle or any heavyweight training? Your symptoms indicate underlying cardiac (heart) pathology. When there is reduced/compromised blood flow to the heart, it can lead to a variety of symptoms like chest pain/discomfort, sweating, palpitations (the feeling of your heart racing or pounding), numbness/pain along the jaw, left side of neck, left arm and if the flow is compromised outside the heart (like the vessel that supplies blood to the legs)., these symptoms can occur in your leg as well. Cervical (neck area) vertebrae spondylosis (narrowing of disc space between two adjacent vertebrae that cause pressure to the nerves exiting the area) can result in numbness along one side of the body (commonly). I recommend you see your physician. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment will enable quick recovery and prevent complications. Bloating basically occurs when there is excessive gas formation in the stomach, bowels, and can occur due to improper dietary habits, poor circulation and certain medicines. Hope this helps.

The sharp pain in the upper abdomen as described by you can be due to muscle sprain.

Norfloxacin acts in kidneys, bladder and prostate. However, the beneficial effect depends on whether that particular bacteria are sensitive (i.e. gets killed by the antibiotic) to norfloxacin. Since you have been having recurrent infections it is always better to start antibiotic according to urine culture and sensitivity. Since you are having improvement in your symptoms, norfloxacin is acting well. Lactobacillus acidophilus and bilious are good bacteria that will help in preventing recurrent UTI. They are safe to take with norfloxacin. Did you undergo an uroflowmetry (test to detect and obstruction in urine flow)? You may need to be evaluated and treated for any obstruction in urine flow due to prostate enlargement, since this can cause recurrent UTI. Take a lot of fluids, pass urine at least once every 2 hours and take cranberry extract capsules twice a day. Small cysts in kidney are not a cause for concern. If you have diabetes or hypertension, these need to be controlled properly to protect your kidneys. I am available for any more clarifications you need, Wish you good health,"

From the description of your situation it is likely the collapse you had was diagnosed as a vasovagal syncope. The tingling that you are having maybe a result of the fall. It would be helpful to know your age, if you have diabetes and if you have had such tingling episodes before. Tingling stems from involvement of a nerve in the arm. The nerve may be pinched from a bulging disc or stenosis in the spine or peripherally like in carpal tunnel syn Chat Doctor.  In my opinion if tingling symptoms resolve on their own nothing needs to be done.

I want to know her reports mainly serum urea, creatinine, electrolytes, mammogram, urine examination, ultrasonography of urinary system, blood gas investigation, urinary protein loss if done.

What was the cause given for ARF? Whether there is need for hemodialysis? In case of Acute renal failure most of the time there is underlying cause like infection of kidneys, severe deny Chat Doctor. In most of cases treatment of underlying cause suffice, once underlying cause is corrected ARF start resolving.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My husband who is 69 and weighs 190 lbs. recently had a below the knee amputation.  Within one month the lower limb was infected and he is now in the hospital after they did an above the knee amputation.  I have a couple of questions.  First, the surgery was done this past Monday late afternoon and when I left today which is three days later he still did not have any bandages or wrappings covering the incision/staples and a small open area for drainage of blood.  After the first amputation the doctor had specific wound care orders which was dry dressing to be checked every day and changed every day.  This time...the doctor signed off the case within 24 hours and left no wound care instructions.  I have been asking the nursing staff, the hospitalists, etc. why the limb is not covered and today my answer from two doctors and a wound care nurse is that it is better for it to be free from dressings and just be open air.  I told them I didnt agree and that did not go over well and was told when I receive a medical degree or nursing degree then I could voice my opinion.  I am extremely concerned about infection as his first amputation was infected and is still on IV antiobiotics for treatment of the infection.  He has had periperal vascular disease for 15 years and the amputated limb has an old graft that took three angioplastys to open the blockage for the first amputation.  My husband has had a Urinary Tract infection since the first amputation up to today.  They had to drain his bladder twice because the readings were showing urine retention in the 700 range.  I mention this because one of the doctors who is refusing to bandage his upper limb says if the urine should get in his open new wound it could not cause an infection?  I also questioned dirty sheets being placed on top of the wound, my husband touching the wound with dirty hands and just plain old germs that are everywhere in the hospital.  Isnt a Urinary Tract Infection mean there is bacteria in the urine.  Because he has had this UT Infection he has been using a urinal and it spills all the time.  The would and open incision are very close to his penis and the urinal is touching his limb all the time.  Should I be worried about infection without this wound/staples being bandaged and the fact the urine is getting on the open wound area.  The lower limb was so badly infected that it had turned black and their was no choice but to amputate higher.  Shouldnt the doctors/nurses be more concerned about infection setting in this new amputation would or am I just worrying needlessly?  Please reply as soon as possible as this is really stressing me by worrying about him and his care he is receiving.  Thank you so much in advance for any help or answers.  Sincerely, a very concerned wife/caregiver.","Thanks for consulting. I have carefully worked through your case, and I can realize your health worries. Being your physician, I assure you not to worry as I will take care all of your medical concerns. Your husband must have got the urinary tract infection when he was put tube for urine first time. Following an amputation for an elderly person the chance of infection are high so that's why he was given an IV antibiotic. That too if he is having diabetes the chance of infection are even more high. Kindly take care that by no way his urine comes in contact with the amputation wound. The mater of content is not that your husband having urinary tract infection. The normal urine itself is full of germs. Hospital is the worst place to manage the amputated wound like this. Hospitals are full of bad and strong germs. MRSA is a nightmare and is common in hospitals. My advice will be you personally learn from the health professionals and get your self trained in cleaning the wound, and you do it every day from your home. Also it is better to keep the wound open rather than keeping it closed as the temperature inside a closed wound becomes favorable for germ to grow. In open wound the oxygen in air and cooler temperature becomes unfavorable for the germs to grow. But extra care must be taken to keep the bed and bedsheets clean. Keep a check on the sugar levels and keep it controlled in normal range. Hope it helps. If you need further, detailed and quick assistance related to any health issues in the future, feel free to ask me a question directly from my profile. Have a wonderful time ahead. Best Regards!"

In my opinion there are different causes for abortion like:-1)Chromosomal anomalies.2)Hormonal abnormalities like thyroid abnormalities, progesterone insufficiency, diabetes etc.3)Infections like TORCH, CMV, malaria, genital tract infections etc.4)Cervical incompetence where in there is short cervix.etc. As the miscarriage occurred after 3rd trimester the cause might be mostly short cervix. But it is confirmed only after physical examination and necessary investigations.Don't worry once the cause is diagnosed and treated the chances of miscarriage decrease. And all the causes might not get repeated in further pregnancies. Planning the next pregnancy after a gap of 3 months after miscarriage is a good option so that body gets itself adjusted for further pregnancy and meanwhile the thyroid abnormalities, genital tract infections, or any should be checked and treated accordingly. Start taking folic acid supplements one month before planning the pregnancy. So I suggest you to consult gynecologist and follow the instructions. Nothing to worry. Avoid stress. Hope this helps.

In my opinion, we should rule out cardiac cause for chest pain. You are having three risk factors for heart diseases. Diabetes, high cholesterol, sedentary lifestyle. All these can lead to coronary artery disease (CAD). In early stages of CAD, resting ECG cannot be normal. So you should definitely get done 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) and coronary angiography (if required) for the diagnosis of CAD. Strict control of diabetes, cholesterol level and weight reduction is needed. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query.

I understand your concern. Gestational diabetes is a cause of increased amniotic fluid.  The explanation is as follows.  Due to gestational diabetes, fetal blood sugar is raised & this leads to excessive urination in fetus (osmotic effect). Which causes increased amniotic fluid in gestational diabetes.  As an effect of gestational diabetes, apart from maternal complications, fetus has high birth weight/pregnancy can turn in premature labor, abnormal fetal presentation during childbirth.  Please don't worry these can be prevented by controlling gestational diabetes by lifestyle changes & few medications (as per advise by treating doctor ) Thanks."

I am 76 and except for the recent diabetes, I am healthy. No other medications. No allergies. Is it the metformin or the humolog or lantus that is having an effect on my energy level? Thanks for your answer.","Hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. Low energy can be a symptom of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia can be a side effect of Humalog or Bantus. At the other side unusual tiredness, or weakness can be a symptom of lactic acidosis, a side effect of metformin. Other symptoms of lactic acidosis include abdominal or stomach discomfort, decreased appetite; diarrhea; fast or shallow breathing; a general feeling of discomfort; severe muscle pain or cramping. If you do not have any of these symptoms (apart low energy), Lactic acidosis can be excluded. I suggest checking your blood glucose several times every day(for some days)fasting, 2 hours after meals or random to see of you have hypoglycemia. In this case your insulines and your diabetes is the culprit of your low energy. If you do not have hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis, i suggest consulting your doctor for further investigations.(If the weakness persist)Hope I have answered to your questions.

Straightening and other procedures have poor effect on hair health and make the hair week in long term.4. Long duration disease like malaria, typhoid, or other chronic disease can cause poor growth of hair. Specially after few weeks of starting of disease. Treatment1. Have good sleep. Food., green vegetables, fruits2. Take iron and multivitamins like collinear at least 3 month.3. Check you blood hemoglobin if it is less iron and folic acid supplements should start.4.

I am allergic to preservatives and I am taking Lantus at night and I have started getting symptoms of allergies, coughing and wheezing.  Have been on the Lantus for about 5 weeks.  I stopped injecting Lantus 48 hours ago and my symptoms have subsided.",Hi. It's not possible to get insulin without preservatives. Insulin is degraded and it becomes impure without them. Since you have found such a strong correlation between your symptoms and insulin use my advice would be for you to undergo desensitization under the care of a dermatologist. Prior to that please undergo a patch test. If you can be managed with other injectable preparations for diabetes you should consider that. Take care.  Chat Doctor.

First, I would like to have some more information on you: - How old are you?- Do you suffer from any other disorders like hypertension or diabetes?- Have you ever suffered from depression? You should know that memory loss and lack of sleep can be related to different disorders like Dementia, Alzheimer, Depression, Thyroid dysfunction, Vascular Dementia, Vitamin deficiency, etc. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam and some cognitive. A brain MRI is necessary to exclude possible brain atrophy. Some other tests may be needed (thyroid hormone levels, blood lipid profile, vitamin E levels, Vitamin B12 levels, complete blood count, etc.). If all these tests result normal, I would recommend consulting with a psychiatrist to exclude depression or anxiety, which can lead to insomnia and lack of concentration, mimicking dementia symptoms.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi I am 30.5 weeks pregnant. This is my 3rd child. The first two children I ate the standard american diet and drank soda and no water. I gained 100 pounds with each of them. We changed our diets before I got pregnant and I was at my lowest weight since I had my 2nd child. We eat alot of fresh fruits and veggies, no meat (we do eat fish and eggs and cheese) and I drink ALOT of water - every now and then I have a regular soda. The first 2 trimesters I exercised regularly. I do not have high blood pressure, no headaches, no throwing up, no blurred vision and no swelling. I did strips to test my ketone level and glucose level today and they were VERY high. What does this mean and what can I do to get it under control. I need to mention that the first 2 trimesters I ate all the time and now my stomach can not hold alot of food - I really don t get very hungry anymore. I gained 15 pounds and I checked my weight again 2 days ago and I lost 5 so this pregnancy I have gained 10 pounds. My stomach is huge but I am losing weight everywhere else - you can really see it in my face.","Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The greatest likelihood in your situation is that you have gestational diabetes. The majority of the time during routine prenatal care for diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. Ketones, a byproduct of sugar metabolism being present in your urine along with sugar backs up the diagnosis. If you're test for gestational diabetes was performed more than a month ago, or if you never had one, I suggest you share these results with your healthcare provider as they may want to repeat the test. Gestational diabetes can be controlled sometimes with diet, however many women require oral hypoglycemics or insulin to control their blood sugar. This risk is increased in women who are obese or who have a family history of diabetes. So needing additional help in reducing your blood sugar during pregnancy is common and is not the fault of an inability to properly follow a proper diet. So I suggest for the benefit of the health of your pregnancy that you make an appointment with your prenatal care provider and that you discuss your results with them, they may want to do more intensive screening for diabetes and depending upon the level of your blood sugar may prescribe medications. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, "

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello Dr: I m 55yr old, diabetic, but under control, take insulin as well as metformin, & crestor. At least 2-3 times a week while sleeping I have to get out of bed because of extreme painful leg cramps below the knee. But they are not strained muscles related but more tendon like. Its as if my leg, can be one or both are locked in an unusual position that requires me to stand and force the relaxation of the leg by stretching or massaging for at least 1/2 hr or more. Any guidance would be appreciated. Richard","Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned the muscle cramps, it could be related to diabetes as some people report the same symptoms. Depending upon the history of the diabetes like how long it is persisting can help assess better. Also, are performing any regular exercises for controlling the blood glucose levels. If not then exercises are a must for a diabetic, not just only walking. As due to diabetes there is a possibility of the freezing of the nerves and muscles which leads to the abnormal cellular metabolism and lead to muscle cramps. Also, you can check the lumbar spine assessed with the MRI scan to rule out any degenerative disc pathology. As even with the possible of the degenerative disc pathology the cramps are possible. Treatment will be guided based on the diagnosis. Also, exercises are recommended in both of the cases for better cellular functioning and metabolism. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. "
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","A diabetic. Age 50 male. All of a sudden for last 3 days, unable to read anything close, especially small letters. For examples, cannot read the notifications on the cell phone. Especially on the left eye feels like there is something bluring the vision. Was told the feeling is like if the pupils are dialated.For the past 3 days, he is also having flu like symptom with flem and voice change.Should he be worried?","Hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. Chronically high blood sugar from diabetes is associated with damage to the tiny blood vessels in the retina, leading to a chronic complication of diabetes called diabetic eye disease or diabetic retinopathy. The risk of diabetic eye disease increases the longer a person has diabetes. The disease often progresses unnoticed until it affects vision. Rapid tightening of blood glucose control leads to transient deterioration of diabetic retinopathy. In my opinion this can be a potential cause of his sudden visual problems. Anyway I suggest consulting an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive dilated eye exam for the right diagnose and treatment. Hope this information is helpful. If you have other questions, feel free to ask. I will be happy to help.(you can ask me at Chat Doctor at my private link: bit.do/ChatDoctor- Chat Doctor. "
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Does we have antidose for Steroid.actually ,my wife taken some ayurvedic/traditional drugs for cure of Asthma,after two months she found her total body getting swelling,so discontinued the medicine.upon enquiry the person whod given those medicine admitted to used some steroids.though for Asthma she take the help of inhaler and under control but,her body is in swelling condition for last one month and feels severe pen while walking.plz advise the remedy.","Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your wives history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. Side effects of steroids are more common if they are taken orally or injections. I would first think that she has had side effects due to oral steroids which were mixed in medicine. Common side effects of oral steroids are weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, gastritis, and many others...2. Many of the inhalers for asthma also contain steroids, but they are in inhaled form, and they are minimally absorbed in blood. Hence, they usually do not cause such side effects. Hence, they are much safer for long term use as compared to oral steroids.3. As she has already had side effects, unfortunately there is no antidote. Side effects of oral steroids can decrease with time (a few months) after discontinuation. Though she will be able to use inhalers as per her doctors' advice.4. For better asthma management, I would suggest her to consult a pulmonologist or allergy-asthma specialist who will assess her symptoms in detail and will prescribe necessary treatment.5. I would also suggest her regular yoga & Panama, regular exercise like walking which increases immunity and lung capacity over long time.6. I would also suggest her a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals which will gradually improve her immunity over long time.7. Regarding pain while walking, it could be due to overweight, but it is important to know exactly which part of leg is aching to guide further. An orthopedic consultation may be helpful if pain is severe/of long duration. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish her the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."

If she has frequent need for Chat Doctor.  However, there is a good chance she has a cyst on her ovaries. These cysts get larger to expel an egg.

Welcome. Significant insulin resistance of pregnancy develops only in third trimester, gestational diabetes sets only in this period. Your sister is having impaired glucose tolerance test(IT). Usually blood glucose is normalized after delivery. Do an oral glucose tolerance test after 6 weeks of delivery. Women having gestational diabetes are at higher risk to develop type 2 DM during later part of life. No problem to your baby at the moment. Good luck."

(and I have a couple of good physicians but its 6 pm on Sunday...","Hello, I understand your concern. Famotidine is not known to increase blood sugar. The blood glucose value tested without of date strips is likely to be wrong. The A1c is an average of the blood glucose over a period of 3 months. It is helpful in knowing the over all diabetes control. A low fasting blood glucose can compensate a high after food glucose and make the A1c normal. This is not good diabetes control and the complications of diabetes can be high in such individuals. So it is good to check the fasting blood glucose and 2 hour post lunch blood glucose in addition to A1c to reduce the risk of complications due to uncontrolled diabetes.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. It appears to be varicose veins.2. Individuals who stand for a longtime are very much prone to it. The veins in the legs, due to long-standing fail and hence blood stagnation becomes common. A color Doppler of the veins will confirm the diagnosis.3. It is not related to diabetes.

Read and understood the history about your father. The slippers meant for diabetic patients can be made at home, you have to buy thick padded slippers made up of rubber. You can mark the area of affection on the foot with a marker and take impression on the slipper. Cut that part with a cutter to accommodate the lump so that the pressure on it will be nil. Well as a Surgeon I would examine the lump, try to see the reason and then only decide whether to keep it or to excise it. Keeping some lumps can cause more complications later. I would also go for preliminary color Doppler study of the foot to see whether the vascularity is compromised or not, a very important aspect in diabetes. Keep the sugars within normal limits."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi Dr, I have been having problems with my spine and back, hip, and leg pain for the past six months with chronic pain. I went to a orthopaedic surgeon last week for a second opinion, but he could not find any reasons (from my xrays) why I would experience pain chronically. I then went to see a chiropractor who helped a lot, and the pain eventually went away, but short lived. It is slowly returning again. The chiropractor noticed that I have a number of anomalies over my spine and missing a pair of floating ribs (previously thought by first orthopeadic surgeon as having an extra vertebrae). There seems to be some kyphosis and possibly Scheuermann s, however they say it is not the reason for the pain. I used to give yoga classes, which I cannot do now anymore, and struggle to find a way to manage my pain, apart from the chiropractor s help, which is short lived. No-one can give me answers, and I keep on struggling with pain shifting around all over my back, hips, legs, knees, feet (more recently), arms and between the shoulder blades. I have severely decreased my medication intake as suggested by the dr (for the last month I have been taking Tramacet tds, and Celebrex 200mg bd to be able to continue working). It has only been a week and a half and I already feel like increasing the dosages again. I only take the medications at night at this time. I really want to know if I am going to struggle with this condition for the rest of my life, and if I will ever be able to do exercises such as yoga again.

A couple of months later I started to suffer from recurrent infections and illnesses. In the last 2 years I have had many infections including:Recurrent UTIs, kidney infection, recurrent uvulitis, ear infections, recurrent thrush, lymphadenitis and cellulitis (the last 2 requiring hospitalisation). I have also had lots of viruses, colds and flu symptoms. I also suffer from a lot of sores, on my mouth and in my nose, and get lots of mouth ulcers. On a regular basis I suffer from migraines/headaches, aching limbs, neck, shoulders and backache, numbness in arms and hands, with loss of dexterity in the fingers, fatigue, skipped heart-beats and chest pain, brain fog (confusion and memory problems, sometimes slurred speech) and occasional blurred vision, occasional low grade fever, and more recently muscle twitching, spasms and cramps. I eat a healthy diet although I am unable to exercise due to chronic pain. I have put on 2 stone in 2 years but this may be due to lack of exercise and my age - 40 years. ( I am now about a stone overweight) I have also had bouts of depression, usually as a result of being so fed up of it all. I was referred to an Infectious Diseases Specialist about 18 months ago, and initially it was suggested possible CFS.

Your symptoms are pointing towards a chronic urinary tract infection which could be due to a persisting systole. Loss of weight could be due to chronic urinary tract infection if you do not have diabetes and your HIV status is non-reactive. Coming out of urine while sneezing is possibly due to the weakness of your pelvic muscles. You can try Keg gel exercises to improve on it.

As by performing the exercises for strengthening the core, pelvic floor, spinal muscles and lower limb muscles helps to reduce the symptoms and eliminate as well. As post lumbar spinal fusion, there is a change in the biomechanics of the spine as well as the muscles of the spine too. For which the rehabilitation of the spine is a must to avoid any recurring symptoms which were the priority for undergoing surgery. Also, that you have to give your 100% to rehabilitate the spine now as to avoid the future symptoms again. I have found 99% of success in my clinical experience. & the symptoms are due to muscle spasm for which initially the therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy have helped a lot. Later stages a good spine rehabilitation protocol is implemented since you have surgery performed the protocol will be differences to get the torque in the muscles to the optimum. I wish and hope to see you recovered soon. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. "

So there is the rise of sugar level in blood, this high sugar containing abnormal blood flows in all organ & parts of the body. Everywhere there are some adverse reactions due to that abnormal blood. In spite of high sugar in the blood, tissues are not getting sugar for energy. So, the alternate process starts in our body to get energy from fats and protein mass like the muscles of our body.

I understand your concerns about asthma medications becoming addictive. Here are few facts about asthma that might help you. What is asthma? Asthma is a disease of airways resulting from constriction of airways leading to wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulty. Like diabetes, hypertension it is a long term disease. There is always an ongoing inflammation of airways resulting in on and off worsening of asthma attacks.  Why do we need long term medications? Two types of medications are available. Reliever medications like leveling which cures an attack, preventer medications like Decor(steroids) which prevent future episodes from occurring. We take medications for diabetes, hypertension for a long period but never complaint about taking them. Since asthma is also a long term disease, preventer medications has to be taken for a long time. But good news for you is a good percentage of child Chat Doctor.  I feel worried that my child may get dependent to inhalers ? This misconception creeps in everyone's minds when they think of inhalers. For becoming addicts, medicines should reach brain. They should give a pleasurable feeling resulting in craving to have more and more. But such phenomenon doesn't happen with asthma medications. They reach only lungs, act on airways, reduce inflammation and never reach anywhere else. That is why inhaler medicines don't cause side effects like tremors, palpitation as oral medications do. Inhaler medications are perfectly safe and don't cause addiction. Hope your child outgrows asthma. Till then take preventer medications. Keep in touch with your doctor. They will increase or decrease medication dosages based on your children response. Hence regular follow up is needed. Regarding your child not gaining weight, I need your children weight and what all she takes for whole day. Have a good day."

Some of the symptoms that lead to the test include, severe dizziness--2 mos; numbness on the right side of my face--2 mos; poor word recall; severe fatigue; and a general feeling of fogginess. Here are the MRI results: EXAMINATION: MRI Brain without contrast. CLINICAL HISTORY: Right-sided facial numbness COMPARISON: CT head dated 7/24/2014 TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MR imaging of the brain without intravenous contrast was acquired. FINDINGS: The ventricles are of normal size, shape, and contour for the patient s age. There are several (approximately 6-7) scattered punctate foci of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity involving the periventricular and subcortical white matter. The largest is a periventricular focus in the left frontal lobe measuring approximately 4 mm in diameter (axial FLAIR image 22). These foci are nonspecific, and slightly greater than expected for the patient s age. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or hydrocephalus. There is no mass effect or midline shift. Diffusion weighted imaging reveals no diffusion restriction to suggest acute infarction. The visualized skull base and calvarium demonstrate no significant abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of an acute intracranial process. 2. Scattered punctate foci of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity involving the periventricular and subcortical white matter. This is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in the setting of chronic microangiopathic change, migraines, demyelinating disease, and various other inflammatory/infectious etiologies.

Your MRI scan brain findings are explained below.FINDINGS:1. The ventricles are of normal size, shape, and contour for the patient s age. There are several (approximately 6-7) scattered punctate loci of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity involving the periventricular and subcortical white matter. The largest is a periventricular focus in the left frontal lobe measuring approximately 4 mm in diameter (axial FLAIR image 22). These loci are nonspecific, and slightly greater than expected for the patient s age. This shows possible small vessel disease. It is expected in the elderly age group, but there is a mention that having 6 to 7 such lesions is slightly more than usual. These findings can occur earlier in hypertension and diabetes and if you do not have these conditions, other disease involving cerebral vasculature must be thought of.2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or HY Chat Doctor.  There is no mass effect or midline shift. Diffusion weighted imaging reveals no diffusion restriction to suggest acute infarction. The visualized skull base and calcium demonstrate no significant abnormality. This details that there is no sign of acute stroke like episode and the findings are more of a non stroke origin. In conclusion, the above findings are indicative of microangiopathic changes in small vessels in brain. These are non-specific and can cause symptoms like migraines, vertigo and slight fogginess related problems. A repeat MRI scan brain might be required in 6 months to a year if there is sudden progressive symptoms from the ones you are having. Medications might be given to preserve your brain microangiopathic changes and reduce the symptoms."

Though there are varied causes of such sudden accidental death of the fetus in last trimester of pregnancy, let us consider the commonest cause. One thing is sure that this is a sudden acute episode causing death of the baby. Chronic starvation of baby would have retarded the growth of the baby rather than its death. Diabetes is the commonest cause of sudden intrauterine death of fetus without any other symptoms. Was she tested for blood sugar? If not please get it done with understanding that many times the diabetes shows temporarily during the pregnancy and afterwards becomes latent and non-detectable. The other commoner cause is sudden separation of the placenta. However, usually there is some cause behind it like high blood pressure, diabetes, excessive water around the baby, some bolt on the abdomen, etc. Such separation causes pain in the uterus and may cause some amount of vaginal bleeding - which may not be there also. Please try to explore these possibilities by discussion with your Obstetrician. If you want to discuss this in details with me, you may ask me a Direct question. I hope this gives you some direction.

Complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, blood Urea serum, liver function tests, creatinine, urine routine examination, lipid profile, thyroid function test, fasting blood sugar., ANA. I presume that you have been prescribed vitamin B12 because your vitamin B12 is low. A deficiency of vitamin B12 and vitamin D do produce the symptoms you have described, but it is also important to rule out Diabetes mellitus and thyroid problems as well hence I have suggested a battery of tests. The Maynard type of symptoms may have no cause in which case its idiopathic, or it may be secondary to autoimmune diseases. Your Vitamin B12 deficiency may be nutritional or immunological such as pernicious anemia. Depending on the cause of your vitamin B12 problem you may be treated as a short course of vitamins or life long if it is the pernicious anemia type. If all tests are negative the Reynolds phenomenon may be alleviated by keeping your feet and hands warm by gloves and socks and also avoiding cold temperature. It is important that you should get your feet examined for loss of pulses and peripheral neuropathy. As a precautionary measure avoid walking barefoot and avoid immersing your limbs in hot or cold water. If your lipid profile shows abnormal values that has to be treated either through dietary modifications for mild values or lipid lowering Chat Doctor.  Protection of hands and feet from injury is essential. Smoking aggravates Reynolds.

Explanation: My opinion is that negative troponin level and normal EKG is not enough to exclude an ischemic heart disease. A HERD you say you have may also lead to that symptom, but first you should work up ischemia panel. I suggest my patients the following: Do some stress testing like treadmill testing to exclude ischemic heart disease and work on risk factors if any exist as diabetes, smoking, hypertension, obesity, etc. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion.

Will All the TB patients get this type of headache r back pain???","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No, headache and back pain are not common symptoms of tuberculosis. She is diabetic, so uncontrolled diabetes can cause similar symptoms. So first get done sugar levels too see diabetes control. Diabetic patients are also at risk of disseminated TB (spread of tuberculosis in other organs). So we should also rule out spinal and meningeal tb as a cause for her back pain and headache respectively. So get done MRI spine and MRI brain. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your sister. Thanks."

A friend has mentioned TIA, which I have now researched. The symptoms all match, including the length of time they last. I have however, had an Mri 3 months ago whicChatDoctore back all clear. Would TIA have been picked up on the MRI? Donna","Dear Donna, Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. It would be helpful for us to analyze if you describe your symptoms in detail. If you think your symptoms are fitting in TIA(Transient Ischemic attack of brain) you have to undergo stroke work up to know the exact reason for symptoms. MRI can pick up TIA s but not all the time. So I would advise you to see a neurologist at the earliest and have a full stroke work up to prevent further stroke. Usually they will investigate you to know the source of your problem with carotid Doppler(to rule our carotid stenosis), echocardiogram(to rule out any cardiac source - blood clots from heart travel to brain and can give you stroke). Apart from the investigation it is very important to control your risk factors like hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia if you have any of these conditions. Visit a neurologist at the earliest."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello Dr. Grief, My husband is 76 years old and has always been strong and healthy. He had open heart surgery 7 years ago that included a triple by-pass and a new aortic valve. He had an excellent recovery. Last year he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and he takes metformin and glyberide. His sugar levels are always good and very consistent. Three months ago his doctor noticed that his red blood count was low (120) and the level continued to fall down to 100. He has had an endoscopy, colonoscopy, echocardiogram, and a Trans Esophosegial Echocardiogram - all with excellent results. There is no physical sign of bleeding, yet his RBC remains low even though he is taking 3000 mg of iron daily. He is scheduled to see a haemotologist at the end of this month. Would your recommend other diagnostic tests that might solve this mystery? Thank you! Rosemary","Hi, this is Chat Doctor.  I suggest a workup for serum ferritin, TBC and transferring saturation. Those tests tell us whether iron stores are normal-low or high. Some patients have normal to high iron stores but still may have low RBC counts like in anemia of chronic disease. I may also recommend serum B12 levels, as patients on metformin are known to develop B12 deficiency which is another cause of anemia. We may review after the results. Hope this helped."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Dear Doctor, my enquiry is regarding my son, he is 31 yrs old and has had juvenile diabetes since he was 23 years old. For a year now he is moody, very short tempered to the stage yelling and screaming at friends and family.Extremely prickly if questioned and gets very angry if plans have been made and then change, even if it is the slightlist change as in street direction or maybe lets go to the eatery next door instead.  Did this come from his relationship break up or is his diabetes developing into something else.  I feel he is depressed and hope it is not bipolar. He is very slim, and exercises a lot, probably not wholly following a good insulin plan.  After being very angry with me he will phone and ask he we want to go out for coffee or lunch the following day,  I see signs of the son I used to have.    Am I overreacting?  My plan if I can get him on the good day is to take him to a Diabetes specialist for a start and maybe some antidepressants for a kick start in the mornings, what do you think? Jacky","! Jacky I really appreciate your efforts for the treatment for your son, and you are not overreacting at all. From what you have said in question I can say from my clinical experience that your son is having some autistic features (as he strictly follows the same routine and throws tantrums when routine is changed). His mood swings might be related to such events as I can guess otherwise he would talk to you normally. You have not mentioned so, but such people are also strict about their dietary habits and may go to extremes patterns to follow it. The point which is against autism is that he developed this pattern just a year back and not from childhood. Such features are also seen in a condition called OCD. You have said that he looks depressed, which can be seen in OCD (comorbid depression). You have mentioned mood fluctuations in which one side is that -- he gets angry and yells and screams, but the other side is not reflective of manic features, so, I donor think that he is bipolar. However, making a correct diagnosis the psychiatrist must interview the patient herself. One thing is definite that your son needs help and I'm sure that medicines will help him a lot, more than you may even think of. So, I would suggest that you must make a visit to a psychiatrist with him. When medicine will start showing effect his diet will also improve apart from his behavior, this will help in managing diabetes as well. You have asked if these symptoms are related to diabetes or not. Well, I have not gone across any such research work till now where diabetes itself is a cause for such symptoms in any patient. So, it looks unlikely to be so. As you have mentioned that he had a breakup, which can be taken as a stressor, I think it might be related to his current condition to some extent. Hope the reply is useful for feel free to ask more questions"

We tested it again after 15 days and now again the levels are slightly high. Can you please tell me what we should be doing?","Your level Fasting: 145 PP: 275 is definitely high, but single high reading does not make it diagnosed as diabetes. There are many reasons for this increase. So you need just to check the sugar level two to three times after intervals of 15 days or a month. If it is still high then start anti-diabetic diet, and if it is still high after that then only go for the medicine. If it remains persistent high hen go to the physician and take medicine accordingly."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have swelling and severe pain and burning in my toes (for 18 months). Gout and diabetes have been ruled out. An EMG over a year ago said it was not neuropathy. A friend was told by her oncologist to take B6 to ease neuropathy-like pain during chemo treatment. Is this a possible solution for me?,"Hi there, welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your question. Swelling with pain and burning over toes can be most commonly caused by conditions like Diabetes and Gout, which have been ruled out in your situation. Neuropathy is a generic term used for a set of conditions which can result in the symptoms u have. Most commonly such systemic conditions like diabetes or vitamin deficiencies would cause symptoms on both lower limbs.EMG in isolation would be insufficient to rule out all kinds of neuropathy. Additional tests like blood tests for vitamins, nerve conduction studies for nerves would help in ruling them out. If your symptoms are only one-sided, regional causes like pressure on nerve at certain points of your limb need to be ruled out. Narrowing of blood vessels in your limbs can also lead to such symptoms. Any injury in the past can also present with pain and swelling now. In addition, there are certain medications which can cause similar symptoms as a side effect. I would suggest you to meet your physician for further evaluation and follow up with a neurologist. Since smoking is associated with and can exacerbate all kinds of neuropathy, you should consider quitting it, if you do smoke. Hope this answers your query, Thank you. With best regards.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","A 54-year-old Type-A male business executive had been experiencing migrainelike headaches. One afternoon he also experienced light-headedness, slurred speech and mildly impaired motor function on his right side. One of his colleagues rushed him to the emergency room of a nearby hospital where blood pressure, blood gases, electrolytes, and an ECG were run. His blood pressure was 195/100 mm Hg, which he said was typical of what he had experienced during the past two years. Blood gases and electrolytes were normal. The ECG showed no arrhythmias but did demonstrate a left axis deviation. The gentleman was admitted to the hospital and a cerebral angiogram was performed which showed left cerebral hemorrhaging. 1. What is the diagnosis of this individual s disorder? 2. What are the major contributing factors to this disorder? 3. What could have been done to prevent this problem? 4. What are the early warning symptoms prior to the complication? 5. Why did the ECG show a left axis deviation? 6. Why was there impaired motor function on the right side from cerebral hemorrhaging on the left side?","Hi, as you mentioned the symptoms it looks like the patient had an early stroke. During the brain stroke every single minute is important. Stroke can be assessed by experiencing the slurred speech, slowing of Motor functions, unable to respond to commands. The first thing need is to get admit to a nearby hospital with a CT or an MRI facility. If the brain stroke is on the left side on the CT or MRI scan than the symptoms will be on the opposite side due to the pyramidal tracts of the nervous system. The design of the human body and its control system by nature is made such that left side of the brain support the right side of the body. Once stroke comes rushing into and emergency room is always advised. Within 3 hours of the first symptom noticed is of priority and importance. Any delay in every minute will damage the brain more. As the blood supply to the brain is restricted by the clot and the damage to the neural tissues keeps continuing. So as soon as one notices the symptoms the earliest you should reach to the emergency room and start the treatment. Well, what could have lead to stroke will be the high blood pressure findings are in common. ECG can be normal can be abnormal. ECG is done to rule out certain factors and focus the whole treatment plan on the brain stroke. That is the reason the ECG is always taken. Brain Stoke can be confined by symptoms and later my MRI or a CT scan. Post stroke if the physical disability is found then a physical therapist is taken into consideration Along with the medication prescribed by the neurologist and the cardiologist. If patient has diabetes than a planetologist should be contacted for the medical part. I hope I have answered your query.

Thank you","Dear Sue, Having history of Pneumonia for several times, history of COPD and having diabetes with the current symptoms of night fever with chills suggest he should undergo test to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis. I do not know which country you are from but the weak lungs and lower immunity due to less hemoglobin and long-standing diabetes makes one prone to get infections which general healthy public can resist. So I hope the test to rule out tuberculosis has been carried out on him. Secondly, having low iron can make his legs very restless, so please get prescription for appropriate iron supplement to ease the symptoms. Neuropathic and muscle pain can be treated appropriately by a planetologist and with optimum it D supplement. I hope he gets relief from his disturbing symptoms with appropriate evaluation and treatment. Do get back for further queries. Good luck."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My father was just rejected for kidney transplant as he is diabetic and on dialysis. The rejection was due to his heart being too weak at 35 percent function; he had congestive heart failure last year. He is 78 years old, but seems strong to me. What would be average expectations?","Hello, for a person to undergo renal transplant, they patient should be fit for the surgery to undergo. For that his diabetes should be well controlled, if hypertension is there then the BP should be well controlled. As for his heart condition where you specified his EF is only 35%, it is quite low. In surgery some time bleeding can occur in which state the patient undergoing surgery should have a heart strong enough to handle the blood loss and decreasing volume. As your fathers EF is only 35%, his heart won't be in condition to handle any situation occurring during surgery. So even if he appears to be fit to you, seeing his heart condition it will be inadvisable for him to undergo the transplant."

I am in pain all the time not only the numbness but the pain.  I was told that the nerve ending would take up to four to six months to heel and maybe even up to eight months to a year.  I am not sleeping at night either - wait up every night around 1:30am and cant get back to sleep most of the time.  Your suggesion.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The recovery depends on the amount of nerve decompression achieved after the spine surgery. It also depends on whether there was any other reason for nerve pain in hands and feet such as diabetes or vitamin B12 deficiency. As of now, you could take pregabalin capsules for pain relief.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",hello dr my aunt has been paralysed on her left side due to a stoke for 10yrs now. recently her kidneys failed and she has been refused dialysis due to her paralysis and her suffering diabetes and high blood pressure. drs are saying dialysis will not be effective for a patient like her. This doesnt make sense because my mother has the same diabetes and high blood pressure and suffers trachy/brady syndrome and sleep apnea and she was offered  CAPD for her kidney failure..,"Hi and thanks for this query.If am sorry about what your aunt is going through. Dialysis clearly helps in cases of kidney failure. I suspect the doctors think she has many other comorbidities that dialysis may not really make any meaningful difference in her prognosis. They may be thinking that there is almost no extra benefit getting her on this procedure. I can only suggest why such a decision might have been made. I think you should consider talking with her doctor to get specific answers to this question in order to better understand the reasons. Besides, how old is she? I wish this really helps and provide some guidance to you. Wish your aunt all the best."

Welcome to Chat Doctor !  I understand your concern. Diabetes may develop due to various factors. The general mechanism is that isle cells of pancreas are not producing insulin which helps in keeping your glucose levels in check or insulin produced isn't acting on the glucose to keep levels controlled. I would suspect diabetes if the random blood glucose levels are anywhere about more than 180 mg/DL and would advise a fasting sugar test and glucose tolerance to conclude for diabetes. Eating healthy and keeping physically active helps delay the onset or keeps it at bay. Hope this clarifies your concern. Thank you for the query. Take care

However, would first want to get a good history on how quickly these symptoms came on and if there's been any let-up.  Next, a physical examination to include blood pressure and then, laboratory testing to make sure you're not suffering from thyroid issues, diabetes, or chemical imbalances of some sort (B12, vitamin D, folate, electrolyte deficiencies).  If an MRI is being scheduled I'm thinking that they are trying to be sure that you do not have any types of tumors, aneurysms, or even congenital intracranial anomalies which by your symptoms doesn't seem to be the case.  Worry and anxiousness can also trigger these sorts of symptoms especially the tingling and floating sensations you mention.  Is there anything of a stressful nature in your life right now that you'd rather be WITHOUT because often times if you can identify such a thing or things, get rid of them (legally!

In my opinion sudden cause of death at term in an uncomplicated pregnancy might be tight cord around the neck of fetus. It is always good to observe for fetal movements daily to know the well-being of fetus. Because before any compromise occur the fetal movements get decreased. So once less movements are felt one needs to get conscious. Anyways don't worry. Avoid stress. It might not be repeated in further pregnancy. So relax.

So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My aunt had her big toe amputated in October due to an abscess from diabetes. She had an infection once already. Last week when she went to foot Dr, another infection set in. The culture came back positive for E-Coli. How could she have gotten that in her foot?","Hello, Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns. Your query is understandable. E cold is normally present in the gut and does not cause any harm. But some strains of E Cold can cause intestinal and urinary tract infection. Uncommonly E. coli can cause skin infections especially in diabetic patients. They can cause cellulitis and foot ulcers. When patient has diabetes and if it is not properly controlled, their immune system becomes weakened. These people are more susceptible for uncommon infections and also the infections take a long time to settle down. E. coli could have colonized the foot ulcer from the own gut, from person to person contact (hand to mouth contact), from contact with animals etc. Hopefully her infection will subside as her doctors have found the causative organism. I wish her a speedy recovery. Regards Chat Doctor. "

Are you on any medications, if so which? Usually, 1 in 6 pregnancies miscarry, which is fairly common. Two consecutive miscarriages are also seen in about 3% of the women. But if a woman has 3 miscarriages in a row we need to check for problems. I would advise you to try to conceive and take folic acid 5 mg at least three months before getting pregnant. Once pregnant follow up regularly with your doctor, most women after 2 miscarriages go on to have normal full term pregnancies. Unfortunately in a few if miscarriage happens do send the aborts for chromosomal analysis, as that could give us a clue to the cause. Hope this helps. Regards."

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension, usually in young ages, meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem, a cardiovascular pathology. I suppose in your case we are dealing with essential hypertension. It is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure, but it should be treated life longs you are diabetic, and you have cholesterol problems under treatment we have blood pressure target for you bellow 120/80 mmHg. Diabetes and lipid disorders are cardiovascular risk factors, so we have to be much aggressive with our mean blood pressure values. It is normal to have blood pressure values above 140/80 mmHg soon after walking and fast heart beats. It is mandatory to have lower mean values during the day. Physical activity, losing weight and diet will help you to better control high pressure, diabetes and lipid disorder but this doesn't mean that you will stop your medications. Hypertension and diabetes will be treated medically livelong. Keeping on with your diet will help you to stay on lower dosage of medication as long as possible, but you should never stop your blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes medicine. Stopping them will rise all your values again because these are chronic disease. So, my opinion is to keep on with your physical activity and diet, continue your medicine and after two months discus with your doctors for your medicine dosage after measuring once a wile your blood pressure and your diabetes. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards."

I have diabetes also, could this possibly be a kidney infection? I do not drink carbonated drinks often, and drink plenty of water","Hello, There are so many causes of back pain including kidney infection, but we will have to rule out the cause of pain whether there is disc arthritis, spinal infection, spine injury as muscle strain or sprain, kidney infection, calculus or kidney stone, spine nerve compression etc.? If you suspect there is pain due to kidney infection or stone then you must be confirmed that you are doing proper urination, no burning micturition, excessive urination or pain radiation from front to back. Because you are a diabetic patient so must be the rule out exact cause of pain. But it seems to me spinal arthritis of L4 L5 region that's why are having pain after standing from sitting. But it is also possibilities of other causes of pain. Anyways consult the or tho and get some test like x-ray of spine or MRI."

Taking you clinical history and imaging findings in to consideration, your BMI, is 24.8 (on the higher side).

I have tried everything from Benadryl to Zyrtec, to nasal sprays and shots.  Nothing has worked.  A friend of mine recently got a cortisone shot for his cat allergy and was fine withing hours.  How bad are the side effects, what are they, and is it worth the ability to finally breathe?","Hello, I would like to know whether you have nasal obstruction or asthma or both. As you have asked about cortisone, I would like to mention the following:1. Cortisone is a corticosteroid. A single corticosteroid shot usually does not cause significant side effects except pain at the injection site, sometimes gastritis, etcetera.2. Of course, repeated or long term use of cortisone (or any other corticosteroid tablet or injection) can cause various and some serious side effects like gastritis, hypertension, diabetes, psychosis, osteoporosis, weight gain, cataract, glaucoma, suppressed immunity, skin changes, etcetera. So it is never advisable to have corticosteroid tablets or shots without a doctors' recommendation.3. For severe allergy symptoms, intranasal corticosteroids (for nose allergies) and inhaled corticosteroids (for asthma) are preferred, they act locally and do not cause above-mentioned side effects.4. Personally, I would suggest you get allergy testing done which will help you to know the substances you are allergic to and also how to avoid them.5. Please try to avoid exposure to dust, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. A healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etcetera) will also help you in the long run. Hope I have answered your query.

What should be my next move?","Hello, Since you have a history of swollen foot & elevated protein levels you are suggested to get clinically examined by a Nephrologist / Urologist. Get Imaging tests, Kidney function tests, Urinalysis, CBC, etc. done. Healthy kidneys do not allow more protein to pass through the filters. But when the kidneys are damaged, albumen leaks out from blood into urine.  Presently you should cut on salt & avoid taking dairy products, cheese, canned food, cut on noodles & bread. Fish, eggs & meat can be taken once in a day.  Get assessed & treated at the earliest. Nutrition & amount of protein to be taken will depend upon the stage of the kidney disease & body size(BMI).

Sugar levels are similar when we didn t used any insulin s and gave gluformin xl 1000, or when we were giving insulin doses of around 30 units of humalog in total and 20 units of lantus a day. Please advice something.","As you have not mentioned much about her like her age, any other health problems, all I can say is that she must try to increase her physical activity to control blood sugar levels. Diet control as well as exercise helps in controlling blood sugar besides insulin and medications as they work only when diet and exercise is also combined with them. Make sure she eats healthy low fat high fiber diet. Avoidance of fried and oily food, sugar and sweets and inclusion of fresh fruits and vegetable salads help in lowering blood sugar. Walking is the best way to increase physical activity. 30 minutes of brisk walk is advised 3-4 times a week to control blood sugar. Use a glucometer to monitor blood glucose before and after meals, before and after exercise to check how effectively diet and exercise are working. Make any changes in diet and control portion sizes of meals to bring down calorie intake. Hope this will give you an idea on how to manage diabetes in a better way."

Ischemic changes generally occur in conditions like hypertension, altered lipid profile, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis etc. These conditions damage small blood vessels and this leads to ischemia.

What are the risks of chemo and radiation in a situation like this?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Your father is high risk patient as his heart is only 13 % working, and he is diabetic.  So surgery for any cancer will be extremely risky. In my opinion you should first get done PET SCAN to stag his malignancy.  Treatment of any cancer is based on staging.

I understand your concerns. For ideal control of blood glucose your fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 mg/DL and your 2-hour post radial should be less than 160-170 mg/DL. Your random blood glucose should also be less than 170 mg/DL. Seen this way, your blood glucose reading seems alright to me, as I feel both of the tests that you have taken are random. The morning blood glucose is still at the borderline, but your evening blood glucose is quite normal. If you could start exercising, you blood glucose values would come even lower than this. Is there any reason that you are not exercising like arthritis of knees etc.? If you want you could increase your night dose of Metformin to 1000 mg and continue with your morning dose of Metformin 800 mg and recheck your blood tests in a couple of weeks. If your morning blood glucose test reading is too low (like 60-70 mg/DL), you could go back to the 800 mg at nighttime. If you are going to start exercising, then you can continue the same dose of Metformin 800 mg twice a day, as exercise increases insulin sensitivity. I hope this answer has been helpful to you.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi my father aged 66 years when checked for s.creatanine last month it was high as 7. So after checking for a month doctor asked to go for kidney biopsy. So we went for second opinion. That doctor said no need of biopsy it is because of diabetes is high. My father has diabetes for more than 20 years now. So they said just control your diabetes then automatically kidney problem will be resolved. I am confused now. Will you be able to help me?Regards,Dattatraya Bhat","Hi, It is important to know current creatinine levels which will give an insight into the functioning of the kidney. The amount of albumin and proteins leaking in urine are also important. Kidney disease or damage that occurs in people with diabetes is called diabetic nephropathy. This condition is a complication of diabetes. In people with diabetes, the nephrons slowly thicken and become scarred over time. The kidneys begin to leak and protein (albumin) passes into the urine. When kidney damage is caught in its early stages, it can be slowed with treatment. Once larger amounts of protein appear in the urine, kidney damage will slowly get worse. If the second doctor has seen through the reports then he might be confident of making a diagnosis and wants to start treatment based on laboratory reports. Some doctors might wait for biopsy reports."

I m on Zolpidium, Tramadol, Hydroxyzine and Omeperozal. My teeth enamel seem to be thining and some teeth are very thin close to my gums.

So, people with diabetes are at a higher risk for gum problems because of poor blood sugar control. At the other side, as with all infections, serious gum disease may cause blood sugar to rise. In my opinion you may have a periodontal disease. This is the most common dental disease affecting those living with diabetes and your pain can be a sign of mouth problems caused by diabetes.

Mild to moderate left pelvicalyceal dilatation with mild thickening of urothelium.,"Hi, Thanks for writing in. I guess you have got ultrasound scan done, and the report findings are mentioned by you. The details in simple language are below.1. Small kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity of renal parenchymal bilaterally and loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Likely related to chronic medical renal disease. This means that the kidneys have slightly shrunken in size and the appearance of the renal cortex is increased. In other words, the kidneys have started to function below normal and this might be related to conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure should you be having either or both of them.2. Mild to moderate left pelvicalyceal dilatation with mild thickening of ruthenium. The left kidney shows a suspected block in the collecting system and also the thickening of the lining of tubes connecting the kidney to the bladder on the left side. The above findings are indicative of a decreasing kidney function. This needs to be reviewed by a nephrologist, and they might suggest further testing to know the quantitative functioning of kidneys by doing tests like creatinine clearance and radioisotope renal function.

I do want to caution you that we do not have a ""cure"" for diabetes and by using this treatment you may not be helping yourself at all in answer to your question. I can offer a possible explanation, however, as to why your son may have ""improved."" One, he could have had a viral infection that temporarily affected his pancreas and thus his blood sugar. When the infection cleared, so did his blood sugar. Or, as you say, he still has it, but his blood sugar is much lower because he quit Chat Doctor.  I could possibly provide you more effective additions to your Metformin treatment if I knew more about your condition. Personally, if you were my patient, and you were looking for a herbal treatment I would use Barbering at 500 mg two times per day. Studies have shown it to be as effective as Metformin in lowering blood sugars. A side effect of Barbering might be weight loss. And, I would also recommend a healthy diet and exercise program to accompany the treatment. However, you are already on Metformin with heart problems with both conditions being interrelated. Interfering with your current medical treatment by adding a herb that works similarly as your medication may negatively affect your health profile as a whole.  I do advise, however, that if you have been on Metformin for 3 years or more to have your B12 level checked since deficiency of this nutrient becomes more common the longer this medication is used. Always talk to your doctor before self-treating. My sincerest regards, Kathy J. Shatter, MS, RUN"

I ocassionally in the day get some tremors(intention) but its not severe and when focused I notice nothing at all. But lately I have been feeling weird sensations in my hands particularly. My worry is that this will progress to the point that I lose motor function. Is this a possibilty? I do not have diabetes.","Hi, it appears to be a poly neuropathy not related to the fever, it may be related to anemia, hypertension, anxiety, gastritis etc. I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment.

I was recently diagnosed with Peripheral Neuropathy . I do not have diabetes . They can find no cause for the Neuropathy. Tried several medications. Nothing helped. I have severe balance problems and senior tremors. Several years ago, I was diagnosed with Scolliosus and also Stenosis . No reatment available. I recently read something about laser treatment for Neuropathy. Are you familiar with this treatment? It s apparently covered under Medicare and supplemental insurance. Would it be a waste of time and money to try this treatment?","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. It is unfortunate to note that your peripheral neuropathy did not respond to the usual treatments. Also, no cause could be found. In some cases, it is not possible to find a cause for peripheral neuropathy. The best treatments for peripheral neuropathy are pregabalin and methycobal [vitamin 12]. Laser treatment may not work in your case. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. "

I am not alchoholic but I am on cholestrol controlling medicine. I get swelling near toes with pitting and also have pain in soles and around lower extremities. Is there any connection . Is heaviness on right side under the ribs is on account of fatty liver or gastric problem. I don t normally pass gas that often.,"Hello, chopramukesh14,If your blood urea and creatinine levels are a little low, that is good. You don't want hem to be high which would indicate kidney damage. I am glad that you are being treated for elevated cholesterol. Most of the time this may be associated with overweight problem and also diabetes. Make sure you are checked for this through two hour post meal blood sugar level and also HbA1C levels which indicate how your sugar has been in the last three months or longer. Swelling of the feet and toes is indicative of some fluid retention. Make sure that you cut back on your salt intake, and you can use salt substitutes that are available or low sodium variety. I want you to get a repeat sonogram of the liver and get all the liver enzyme tests to see if there are any signs of cirrhosis beginning. It is very important to rule this out. If there is any question, the doctor might decide to do a liver biopsy to correctly assess the level of inflammation or scarring. I also hope that you are on Vitamin-E 800 i.u. daily along with a B-Complex Vitamin. You should be on a low fat diet. Hope this gives you some information that you can discuss with your doctor.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to give you my opinion about this problem and explain you something's. When we treat hypertension our goal is to take mean blood pressure values below 140/90 mmHg and in an ischemic heart disease and diabetic person even lower. In case of your father If I was your treating doctor I will search for reasons that keeps the blood pressure high even taking different medicines as you say. It is essential to control his renal function. A diabetic person might have alterations of his renal functions that maintains his blood pressure high. My opinion is he should do some examinations like blood analyze, creatinine, a cardiac echo. If heart function is normal, if renal function is normal and if I was the treating doctor I should add to B-blockers some other medicine like ACE-Inhibitors like April, enalapril etc. These is a very good class of medicament, very effective, especially in diabetic patients. Of course the dosage should be initiated with the smallest one and then they can be raised or add another class like diuretics or calcium-blocker. So, my opinion is you should not worry and discuss these alternatives with your treating doctor. Hope I was helpful. Best regards."

I have a stone in my pancreas head. so i need help to meet up a doctor in cmc hospital. The size of my stone is (1.5*1.6)cm. And if i suggested to surgery  how much money needed for this purpose. so Please help me and oblige thereby.ThankfullyNayan","Hello Mr Mayan, I am so sorry to hear regarding your condition. Stones in the pancreas head are not very common, but do cause a lot of problems including pain, poor absorption and malnutrition and can also lead to diabetes due to pancreatic failure. There are two ways of dealing with the stone, based on how close it is to the pancreatic duct opening. If it is close to the opening, then it could potentially be treated with endoscopic technique (ERCP). If however the stone is big, then it will necessitate surgery to remove the stone. There are two CMC s in India. Nellore in the south and Ludhiana in the north (where Dayan and Medical College is also located). If needed I can put you in touch with the Gastroenterologist in CMC, Ludhiana. Regarding the cost of the procedure, if it can be done endoscopically, then I would assume a total expenditure of about 35-50 thousand rupees (including the necessary scans). If Surgery is required, then the cost could be around 1.5-2 Lakhs. Hope this helps, and please do not hesitate to contact me for any other details required."

Please help. i need your advice",Hi short answer could be a gangrene Detailed answer Thanks for your question to this forum. Based on the information given by you in this question it seems that you have developed peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy of the toe. Patients with long-standing diabetes are also prone to various types of infection including fungal infection. The physical examination by an expert to conclude the final diagnosis is recommended. Do not scratch but take some antihistamine tablet to prevent itching. Because after scratching and bleeding you are more prone to infection. Thank you

The above lab result is based on the test carried out on 15.07.2012.Please advise the treatment required for the above,"Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I read your question carefully and understand your concern. Your blood glucose test (post postprandial and fasting) indicate a low tolerance towards glucose and probable diabetes. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG and some lab tests : - HbA1c (which indicates the mean blood glucose values during the last 3 months)- kidney and liver function tests-thyroid hormone levels-blood electrolytes,- urinalysis, etc. An endocrinologist consult is needed to start the proper therapy, besides diet modifications (diabetic diet) and physical exercise (including loss of weight). Regarding your cholesterol levels, I would recommend performing also HDL, LDL and triglycerides levels. You should know that total cholesterol is not a pure indicator of cardio vascular risk. The most important indicator of cardio vascular risk would be Total cholesterol/ HDL ratio (and decide if you need any therapy). The increased cholesterol levels may be related also to the diabetes, but some lifestyle modifications (diet, physical activity and weight loss) are helpful, besides possible need of statins.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, My name is AAAAA and I am 50 years old. In 2006 I was treated for Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma . That treatment consisted of Infusion Chemo with 5 Fu, Minomyacin and Cisplatin. I also had 9 weeks of External Beam Radiation. I am 7 years cancer free, which allows me to say that I am cured. Though a major side effect of cisplatin is Peripheral Neuropathy , that never happened to me while I was having treatments or any time soon after treatments. Oddly enough, a year and a half ago, I started having a tingling and burning in a localized area in my right foot. Where the toes meet the metatarsal bones on the foot pad. It started in a small area and slowly began to spread throughout the entire foot pad. It is also now in my left foot, but is worse in the right. The feeling started a a generalized numbness, and is now a combination of burning, tingling,small electric shock feelings in my toes, which only happens sometimes. I finally went to a Neurologist that did an NCR and EMG test. the results came back positive for peripheral Neuropathy. The doctor deemed it idiopathic and offered me drugs to take to alleviate the discomfort. When I asked her what caused this to happen, she said we will never know and the best we can do is manage the symptoms. Well, that certainly did not sit right with me. I have since been on a journey to get to the root cause of this condition. I do not have pain, it is more like a constant chronic irritation, but I do know that this is a progressive condition so I certainly need to take action. My approach is two steps. First I ve researched some alternative treatments and procedures to try to re-establish the current failing health of the peripheral nerves. I just started taking a Neuropathy support formula that contains the more absorbable form of B 12 2000 mcg,B1 300mcg,B6 4mg,B2 4mg, R-ALA 150mg, and vitamin D 500 IU. I am taking this formula 2x a day with an additional 300 mg R-ALA. In addition to this I will be going for treatments using the Rebuilder. This is similar to a tens machine, but uses different frequencies that have been shown to assist in the body s ability to repair. Hopefully, I will get some results with this protocol. The second part of my journey, is the more complicated part. Trying to get to the root cause. I do know that there are hundreds of factors that can contribute to the development of neuropathy. Here are just a few, autoimmune disease, nutritional deficiencies,heavy metal poisoning,hormone imbalances, many metabolic dysfunctions like kidney disease, liver disease, thyroid disease, onset of pre diabetes, digestion issues that can cause chronic long term systemic inflammation, structural dysfunction like spinal nerve compression or stenosis, and peripheral vascular disease. I have already began this journey. I have an appointment with a top Neurologist at the Weil Cornell Medical Center in NYC.He specializes in peripheral neuropathy and has developed a blood test to test to see is the neuropathy is being caused by an auto immune dysfunction. I am also seeing a top spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in NYC. I do have several back issues in the lumbar spine. I have had various MRI s done, at would like them read by a top notch specialist. I will also be having some blood work done to rule out many of the other dysfunctions that I mentioned above. I would also like to check for vitamin and mineral deficiencies. All of these office visits and tests are quite costly, but I will not sit back and wait for my condition to deteriorate. It would be nice to be able to do this all under one umbrella. I did think of checking out the Mayo Clinic, but none of them are close to my home. I d like to know what your opinion is regarding my approach to help find the root cause of this condition, and if you have any suggestions for me. thank you for your time.","Hi, peripheral neuropathy is a side effect of cisplatin, but also associated with systemic disease like diabetes, autoimmune disease. Your ESR report should be mentioned. Thyroid profile and blood sugar report also to be mentioned. If you have any sensory or motor deficit then proper level to found out and MRI can be done. Your decision regarding selection of top specialist is perfect. Specialized opinion is definitely needed. In my opinion gabapentin and SSRI group of Chat Doctor.  Take care."

Rather the anxiety that you have not taken the prescribed Bantus and would it hard would have just triggered the symptoms and in itself this may have given a higher blood pressure reading. So an effect rather than a cause2) However with diabetes your blood pressure should be controlled under 140 / 90.

Certainly your sugars are very high in the morning, and you already know about the dawn phenomenon. I hope you got your endocrinologist on board to help you. Stress is the biggest cause for this along with poorly controlled diabetes. Try to take your evening meal early between 5-6 pm and have a snack prior to going to bed. Take insulin per carb count. This will certainly avoid hypoglycemia at night and hyperglycemia during the morning. Other thing you should do is to keep you sugar levels little high before going to sleep that means decreasing the dose of meal time insulin during the supper time. Do regular exercise after eating to prevent post prodigal high sugars. Good luck"

I am female, 5 8 and 140 lbs (in a healthy range but skinny looking for my frame). What can i do to hold off or better yet, prevent becoming a diabetic? I am afraid to lose anymore weight (by exercising hard and eating little to no healthier carbs) and my GP said that bumping my weight up to 150 would not be a bad thing as i am on the low end of my healthy range. I am starting vingear before meals to see if it helps lower my sugar levels (but afraid it will make me drop weight). Any advice?","Hi With your query, in diabetes to keep the insulin levels normal one have to keep a check to their diet. Yes of course it is necessary to have low calorie diet which helps the body to regulate and utilize the energy that is available in order to maintain normal insulin levels. Often diabetic patients lose weight, but you have mentioned that you are pre-diabetic which means you are prone to diabetes so always maintain good health by exercising but not without proper food. Try to consume low-carb diet with more fiber content. I would definitely say not to worry about unless you stop working out. You are just pre-diabetic have good food with less number of sweets if you are a sweet lover and good protein diet with low calories and more fiber content. No compromise in food unless you stop doing some or the other work out Regards Ramesh"

All my blood counts were normal. i went to an Endo doctor and they tested me and said i had prediabetes and high cholesterol. Would Prediabetes be causing my body to feel this uneasy ? they put me on Metformin and today i tested my blood sugar and it is 120 (2 hours after lunch) . does this sound like the right diagnosis?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have read your question and understand your concerns. I do understand that you are worried about your symptoms. It is good that your MRI, CT scan and blood counts are normal. This rules out a space occupying lesion in your brain which is what majority of patients are worried about when they have a headache along with visual disturbances. Prediabetes is unlikely to cause blurred vision in you. Very high blood glucose can cause blurred vision but in prediabetes, the blood glucose is not that high. Further, by starting metformin your 2-hour postprandial glucose is in normal range. Blurred vision by itself can cause a tension type headache due to straining of nerves. I would advise you to see an ophthalmologist so that you could have a full eye check. I hope this answer has helped you. Thank regards Chat Doctor. "

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your husband is having arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is irregular heart beats. So this can cause fluttering feeling in chest. He is also having heart and kidney disease. He is also diabetic, so all these also favor arrhythmia more. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1. ECG 2. 2 d echo. 3.

Can you give me any advice on what is going on & what I can do to lower these Alk Phos & ALT numbers?","Your Alt and alkaline phosphatase will come down when you stop taking methadone. You can shift to a painkiller like T Etorocoxib 90 mg once daily for pain. You should worry about your HbA1C which shows your diabetes is out of control. You should start anti-diabetic medicines in consultation with a planetologist at once to prevent complications like kidney damage(nephropathy), nerve damage(neuropathy) and eye damage(retinopathy). The elevation of your liver function may also be due to fatty liver which can result from diabetes"
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Hi my father died in May of this year.  He was 83 but had been in relatively good health.  He was diabetic since his late sixties.  When he was hospitalised the doctors said he was in septic shock due to an absess which had developed near his gall bladder.  He had to have major surgery and suffered three strokes before he died.  We have since learned that he had no heating in his house for some months before he died and we had unprecedently cold weather conditions over the winter months.  Some nights the temperature was as low as minus sixteen.  I am wondering how much this contributed to his death.  Any help you can offer would be appreciated as it is really disturbing me.  Thanking you in anticipation--Cathy,Hi welcome to the Chat Doctor In severe cold temperature and changing weather there are chances of viral infections and then secondary bacterial infection can occur Moreover your father was also having diabetes in which chances of infections more...

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Wow... impressive. I am looking for THE BEST Radiologist at reading a CONE BEAM SCAN. Its critical, as I have necrosis in my sinuses, that is getting exponentially worse by the day. The DDS I saw sent me to an Endodontist, who did the scan. He sent it out to be analyzed by ? and the results were: Bone loss to Upper and Lower Jaw; involving some 15 teeth-----BUT SINUSES ARE JUST FINE????!!! Help please. I am frightened by whats happening to me. There is a hole in my Septum that must be considered large by any standard. My nose bleeds daily. and can bleed from both nostrils regardless of the side its coming from. To make matters even worse, I have Mitral Valve Prolapse. WHAT DO I DO? WHO OUT THERE KNOWS HOW TO REALLY SEE WHAT S THERE TO BE SEEN? I NEED ANSWERS & A PLAN OF ACTION, before theres no point in seeking help. Im not clear on the way this chat works. Can someone explain?","Hello, I can understand your concern. In my opinion the bone loss of the upper and lower jaws that is associated with 15 teeth is a different problem than the problem of sinus and bleeding from nose. Let us discuss both problems separately. Usually, the bone level of jaw is where the crown of teeth (the part we see in mouth) and the roots meet. With age, due to lack of proper oral hygiene, due to presence of systemic illness like diabetes or presence of gum disease, the bone level may reduce in size exposing roots, making gums bleed, and making teeth loose in their sockets. Visiting a dentist for this situation will help as dentist will perform scaling and root planing which will remove the bacteria, calculus and debris in the gums making gums healthier and stronger. You can also massage gums by using gumex gel daily for about 10 minutes. Make sure you mention to dentist about your heart valve problem as some treatment modifications will be required for you. Regarding the sinus problem, it is difficult to examine sinuses properly in an x-ray that is taken by dentist for examining teeth and bone status. Also, the problems you are facing of bleeding nose and previous bone scan presenting bone necrosis indicated towards some sinus problem. However, it is difficult to advise regarding that in absence of bone scan examination right now. Thus, I would advise you to visit an ENT specialist for the sinus and nose bleed problems. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,"

Considering whatever your mother-in-law is thinking is wrong then the symptoms you described look like false belief which in medical language is Delusion. The delusion may be a symptom of variety of mental disorder. One would like to know her behavior and belief about many other things apart from relating to you. If she is otherwise finer than delusion disorder can be the possibility. Or if she also has other behavioral problem or thinking problem then one need to rule out possibility of schizophrenia which is not common after middle age. One more thing is her memory. If memory problem is present then dementia can also be the cause. Does she have diabetes or hypertension? If so then chances of dementia due to lack of blood flow to her brain may be the cause of symptoms. This all what I have discussed are common causes of false belief, but it is not the complete list.

After the intake of Urimax 2 mg this frequency has reduced to two or three times a night. My doctor says that albuminurea would reduce stage by stage. I am taking Amaryil 2 mg (twice a day) Ubexo 40 and PPG 2. Kindly inform me what more drugs should I take to reduce microalbuinurea? Also what damage this would create for my kidneys? Thanks,"Hi, Microalbuminuria is a condition in which kidneys start filtering proteins in the urine. It usually occurs in diabetics and occasionally in hypertensives also. To control microalbuminuria, the most important step is to keep your sugar and blood pressure well controlled. Once they are controlled, the further progression of microalbuminuria is slowed down. Salt restriction also helps.  There are certain medications which can be started like ACE inhibitors, but I feel they can only be started after certain investigations like kidney function test and serum electrolytes. Many studies have been carried out to study the complications of microalbuminuria. What I would like to tell you is that if not controlled it can affect multiple organs-esp proteinuria and diabetic nephropathy (diabetic kidney disease) and can even further have cardiopulmonary effects (on heart and lungs).

The tooth infection can be treated by taking a course of antibiotics preferably a combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole.

Y gallbladder removed because of it. What does this sound like? Could I be possibly passing a kidney stone?","Hi. This passing the urinary stone is not likely because this could have caused tremendous pain. The pus, swelling and burning clitoris looks to be a local problem, may be with vulvo-vaginitis and needs active treatment with local application of provide iodine and oral antibiotics. The severe pain in abdomen in the morning can be due to IBS only. Frequency of micturition can also occur in medical problems like diabetes and so get all the blood, urine and stool tests done. Once in a while a CT scan of the abdomen with proper preparation can help to get a differential diagnosis."

So far it was in latent phase; however with the stress of pregnancy, it became overt. Even if your sugar goes back to normal levels after delivery, the diabetes remains in your body - in latent phase and sometimes in the future, it becomes overt. Diabetes is a hereditary metabolic dysfunction which is associated with gene. This gene is recessive gene. Hence, even if only one partner is diabetic still there are chances that the baby will be diabetic. There are two types of diabetes - Type I and Type II. It all depends on which type of diabetes the baby is having. According to the type of diabetes, it will become overt at some age, it may require insulin since childhood, etc. Please report to your babies Pediatrician once to get the baby investigated for the evidence of the Diabetes, if at all she has it. If your husband is non-diabetic, there are good chances that your baby may be non-diabetic since the diabetic gene is a recessive (non-dominant) gene. You need not be under stress. Medical science has advanced quite ahead. Diabetes is not a disease but is a metabolic disorder and hence can be managed chronically with due precautions and treatment. Wish you the best,"

I flew a long distance 6 months later and both of my feet, ankles and legs swelled up again. My family doctor told me it was just the long flight and that I should get stockings and get up during the flight. I disagreed and thought it was related to my Cellulitis and wondered if my Strep infection was cured. I was originally given 3 antibiotics to treat Strep, Mersa and 1 other infection for the recommended length of time, my family doctor said the infection was treated but did not do a follow up blood test for strep. I still have a few red dots on my legs below my knees. I just got back from a trip to Hawaii from Alaska and my legs were fine! Currently, my latest blood test revealed high glucose and high calcium.

Thanks for posting here. I have gone through your description. 60% blockages are considered non-critical. The carotid arteries supply the brain. When you had a TIA a small clot may have been formed at the blockage area and later traveled towards your brain. So you need to be on antiplatelet medications which will prevent the clot from forming. Endarterectomy is usually not done for 60% stenoses. In the future if the block increases in severity, a carotid stenting can be offered. Endarterectomy is a surgery and usually is done if angioplasty fails or is not possible. At present, you need to be on medical management. Also, the RCA has a 60%stenosis which again is non-critical and should be managed on medications. You should be prescribed antiplatelet medications and statins which lower the cholesterol to prevent these cholesterol deposits in your arteries from increasing. You have many risk factors for heart disease like smoking, high BP, diabetes, so you have to continue your BP and diabetic medications along with the above and try to quit smoking.

You are suggested to get him clinically examined by a GP. Get all the blood workouts, Urinalysis, CT, MRI, Nerve conduction tests, etc. done at the earliest. He should also get cholesterol tests, chest x-ray, Duplex scanning, an echocardiogram, an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), an exercise stress test done to detect arteriosclerosis.

My family practice doctor treated me for scabies which I knew I did not have. I have no none food allergies and have stopped eating and drinking everything that I think could be a contributing cause. Oddly, I had been craving tomato juice for weeks and couldn t get enough. That has passed. Also have been experiencing some odd discomfort at the base of my skull that seems to coincide with a weird sensation in my arms and hands. This has been going on for about six weeks. The rash seems to worsen during the evening with no triggers and is helped by lotion. The rash is more like welts than prickly heat and is not a wet rash. It is not hives; I ve had the reaction to shrimp. I don t like taking antihistamines and hence have not. Thanks.","Hello, If the rash that you describe is red, itchy, has raised skin that you can feel, goes away after a few hours only for new ones to appear in their place, does not leave a mark or bruise, then this is acute urticaria. That you have had it for >6 weeks, makes it chronic urticaria. 80% of people with urticaria do not have allergy, although a pre-existing allergy to (say) house dust mite, pollen or shrimp does not make it more likely for this type of urticaria to appear. Infections, underlying thyroid problems, diabetes, inflammation inside the body (can be several conditions, say endometriosis) and stress makes these lesions appear and can last quite long. The treatment (that you don't like) is the right one, long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like Allegra 180 mg once in the morning, and cetirizine 10 mg at lunchtime or evening for 6 weeks (max 3 months). Unless you continue on high dose antihistamines, this will recur. If you think you may have a thyroid problem, get TSH fT4 and TPO antibodies tested. If there is a chance of an infection, please get this checked and treated as well. I hope this helps. Best Wishes."

I will put him on a very strict diet but, I dont know where to start with it, what to give him what not to give him and how much and how little! I have done some research and have now just become more confused. Also, what sort of supplements/vitamins should he be  taking? Thank you SO VERY much for any help.Senada G.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. He is diabetic and hypertensive, so better to avoid sweet, sweetener, rice, potato, fruits like banana, Apple etc. Also avoid high salt diet. Prepare his food in sunflower or olive oil. Both are good for diabetes and hypertension. Regarding prostate cancer, food is not an issue. But maintaining good immunity is important in cancer patients. So give him high protein diet like eggs, beans, legumes, pulses etc. Multivitamin tablet containing folic acid, niacin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, vitamin b12 etc. is also important for immunity. Zinc, selenium, vitamin C etc. are good antioxidants and helpful in immunity, so antioxidants' tablet is also recommended in his case. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi thank you for your interest in helping me. I have been having an uncomfortable feeling on the left side of my head, my left arm and left leg, (feeling you have when sleep on a limb for too long). They did a CT scan, MRI and said everything is normal. The neurologist said it is not a stroke. The only thing they found is cervical spondylosis on my neck which gives me some neck discomfort. I have this feeling mostly at rest, I had pain at the back of my left shoulder went to the ER they did EKG and said it was normal. I m hypertensive on treatment with Losarta, Hydrochlorothiazied, and Potassium. The doctor recommended physiotherapy what could be wrong with me? Please I need help .","Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I am glad that your MRI have resulted normal. This means that there is no infection, stroke or tumor. So, all serious conditions are excluded. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing an EEG to exclude partial seizures. I would also recommend performing thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction, blood electrolytes for possible electrolyte imbalance and HbA1C for diabetes. If all these tests result normal, I would recommend continuing physical therapy. A cervical spine MRI would help exclude possible myelopathy, although your symptoms are not typical of cervical spine compression. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards, "

I have gone through the details given and do understand your concern. However, there is no mention blood glucose level (fasting or PP) and HbA1c%, so there is no way to know whether diabetes is well controlled or not. Secondly no mention ChatDoctor. Persons with diabetes do lose weight at times fairly rapidly, particularly when it is uncontrolled with high blood glucose. That causes excess glucose loss through urine as well as increased frequency of toilet visits including getting up at night. In a well controlled diabetic FBG should be If blood glucose is not well controlled eating well can actually lead to more of glucose loss through urine. So my suggestion is please check your fasting, PP glucose levels and HbA1c% and try to bring those in the above recommended range. Then weight reduction will stop. Strict blood glucose control is the remedy.  Thanks"

I have RA and had a tendon replaced in my foot 5 years ago. I had tests ran by a vein specialist, shows no clots, GOOD blood flow and heart beat. My doctor says no infection or diabetes. The vein specialist said leaking veins.This continues to get worse. I was taking Cimzia for my RA and have stopped for 5 weeks now under doctors direction. Still no relief. I have been taking methotrexate still for RA.","Hi I am Chat Doctor. .  From your given history your swelling could be due to an old trauma, cardiac or renal problems.  If your edema is bilateral this is a sign of underlying systemic disease if cardiac output exceeds its output (heart failure) or your kidneys cannot wash or flush your venous system .in rare cases your medication may cause such symptoms if used for long periods.  You have to maintain leg elevation, avoid standing or bending your knees for a long time and use hot foments with topical gels of anti-inflammatory.wearing compression stockings will be helpful to push up blood towards the heart and increase your venous return.  If you have not examined your arterial system by Doppler U/S you may need to check them up in very rare cases arterial system clots or atherosclerosis may occur and cause such edema.

I had a CT which showed I have a blockage in my Superior Mesentric Artery that is stopping blood flow to my upper stomach and pancreas. I do not have high chlorestal and have always eaten a healthy diet. A1C is 6.3. am having a ultrasound next week and probably a stent put in. When the radiologist did the CT I had a reaction to it and he said I would be better off not to have that or an MRI done as each time the reaction is worse. Dont they have to use the dye to put the stent in and what do I expect for my future health concerning this?,"Hello, Stenting the Mesenteric artery is the best way forward to establish blood flow to your pancreas and stomach. The other alternative is surgery which is far more morbid. Also, the used during stenting is similar to what they used previously in CT. So do discuss it with your doctor, so he may take precautions before the procedure and preferably use alternative dye. Yes follow-up MRI would be better in your case for Evaluation.  Regards "
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",My dad has been becoming more forgetful recently and has a family history of Alzheimer s Disease with a sister who had advanced stages when she died. I ve been researching Axona and was curious if it would have any effect on someone without a diagnosis of Alzheimer s or if it could even be prescribed in his case.,None of the medications we use for Alzheimer's is preventative.  They were not researched in that way nor are they indicated for prophylactic use. Axon is actually a medical food supplement and should not be used in people with metabolic issues such as diabetes as it can cause ethnic shock and coma in extreme cases. I would not recommend the use of Axon in anybody without a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia and only under the direction of an experienced physician due to its side effects which in some cases can be severe enough for people to go the ER.  Good luck.
